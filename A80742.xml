            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Pulpit having made the Author more famous, and in a more <hi>expedient</hi> way than my pen can imitate; and this his booke ſufficiently ſpeaking for its ſelf; I ſhall only preface (as I can amidſt theſe trouble; of times, and mine own buſineſſe) ſomething ſutable to the Contents of the Booke.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Title</hi> tels you it is GOSPEL-LIBERTY, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning NEW-TESTAMENT LIBERTY. For that the Author ſeemes to intend, &amp; attend throughout his diſcourſe. The Contents or Table leades you to the things where hee gives you the juſt dimenſions of his ſence therein. And as
<pb facs="tcp:132715:4"/>often as he is not pleaſed to be expreſſe, and punctuall, hee leaves you hints, and generalls, whereby to abound in your own ſenſe. But beware how ye apply, leſt ye miſ-apply. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> in nothing are more in danger in their whole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, then in their managing of the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty:</hi> And people are moſt in danger in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. For as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> is <hi>Caſe-divinity</hi> (to me the moſt comprehenſive, and curious, eſpecially in the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it down to the infinite of <hi>particulars:</hi>) ſo mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in theſe moſt Goſpel-abuſing times, are exceedingly complexioned to licentiouſneſs. So that wee may ſadly ſigh forth this ſtrange paradox. <hi>In medio conſiſt it vitium,</hi> that is, <hi>In the uſe of middle indifferent things, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted moſt vice.</hi> For in theſe things Profeſſors alſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally offend. Things expreſly <hi>forbidden,</hi> or <hi>commanded,</hi> are too groſſe, and ignominious; for a face that is but <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtated</hi> by profeſſion: But in things <hi>indifferent</hi> there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing a character of lawfulneſſe ſtampt upon them, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors grow too reſolute and peremptory in their uſe, to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate what, when, how much, &amp;c. is <hi>convenient</hi> or <hi>expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi> And thus they precipitate themſelves into licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in theſe offence-giving, and offence-taking times, to the occaſioning of many to ſpew up that rligion they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down. For men now a dayes <hi>will not</hi> rightly underſtand the bounds of <hi>things indifferent;</hi> they <hi>cannot beare</hi> the weight of the <hi>morall Law</hi> under its proper notion, which ſtates what things are <hi>neceſſary,</hi> by prohibition or injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo <hi>do not drink in kindly</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency:</hi> but are at a loſſe in the application of it, &amp; at every turning goe out of their way.

That though Circumciſion in <hi>eſſe,</hi> in <hi>being</hi> now, was not <hi>indifferent:</hi> but in that regard <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily</hi> to be laid aſide; yet at preſent in the <hi>Cognôſſe,</hi> the <hi>generall knowledge of it</hi> among men, it had a kind of notion of <hi>indifferency</hi> upon it. For as yet, in the time of <hi>Acts 16.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> the <hi>ſtature</hi> for it's <hi>repeale</hi> was not come forth under the hands of the Apoſtles (as after it was peremptorily ſet forth, <hi>Gal. 5.2.</hi>) And ſo it could not oblige, untill a due promulgation of it. And ſo mean while, <hi>Paul</hi> might ſome how, <hi>uſe</hi> it as a kinde of indifferent thing in regard of the ſeverall opinions of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in this intervall of time. For thoſe that were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it was in force, would not be offended; And thoſe that thought it abrogated, would not be offended for the ſake of thoſe weake believers that would be offended at the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it; or at leaſt looke on it as a Blank. But for unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that clamoured for it, as <hi>neceſſary,</hi> Paul took more care to aſſert his liberty, then to pleaſe them. All which, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently weighed, and skilfully applyed by <hi>Saints,</hi> may be moſt ſoveraign to compoſe great diſſentings, or at leaſt remove grievous ſcandals <hi>taken,</hi> if not <hi>given</hi> (in theſe peace-leſſe and unkind ſpeaking times) among THEM.

                  <p>The non-obſervation of this rule, ſets the preſent age on fire.

This man that will not ſee hardly his owne <hi>ſinfull</hi> infirmity, will looke keenly into anothers Chriſtian liberty, vote it a ſinne, and paſſe a condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon it.

On the other ſide what meanes the <hi>preface</hi> to the ten Commandements, viz. <hi>I am the Lord</hi> (Hebr. <hi>JEHOVAH) Thy God, which have brought thee out of the LAND of AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GYPT, out of the houſe of bondage?</hi> Doe not theſe words uſher in the Commandements, and ſet them down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the Covenant of Grace?

For the leaſt thou canſt make of it will be thus much, that a working faith is the only living juſtifying faith. Working muſt juſtifie faith to be true faith, as faith juſtifies us to be true Saints. But the juſticiary, that would juſtifie himſelfe by working, he lookes upon all law, both morall, and Ceremoniall, yea and upon the <hi>law of FAITH</hi> too, (as the Apoſtle cals it,) as on works. Thoſe of the Jewes that were ſuch <hi>juſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries obeyed the morall law,</hi> not out of faith, working by love <hi>(Gal. 5.)</hi> but out of ſelfe-love to juſtifie themſelves by ſelfe-wrought righteouſneſſe, <hi>Mark 10.20. Luk. 10.29.</hi> And they <hi>ſacrificed</hi> and uſed other things of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall law, not as an <hi>expiation and attonement,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Chriſt as the kernel, but as on workes, by them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, to their coſt and labour, and ſo reſted in the deede done, <hi>Jer. 7.4.</hi> And ſo the Prophet cals Ceremonies there &amp; <hi>then</hi> lying vanities: And forbids them, <hi>Iſa 1.</hi> Upon this conſideration the Apoſtle ſpeaks acuratly, and preciſely to the falſe notion of theſe Jewiſh juſticiaries, <hi>Rom. 9.31, 32.
<pb facs="tcp:132715:12"/>They attained not to righteouſneſſe, becauſe they ſought it not by faith: but AS IT WERE by the workes of the Law,</hi> meaning, that the law morall, or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall was not <hi>in themſelves</hi> of the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> but by the falſe notion of juſticiaries, they were to them <hi>tanquam WORKES,</hi> they were as ſo to them. to this <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks notably (to this effect.) <hi>Men</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>looke on the law aſquint,</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words that I have read to you, they are the concluſion of <hi>Pauls</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to certaine Queſtions that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (it ſeems in writing) had propoſed to him. What thoſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions were you may read, from the beginning of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, to part of this 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter. I ſhall onely touch them a little; In the beginning of the ſeventh Chapter they had written to <hi>Paul,</hi> and asked him this queſtion, Whether it were lawfull for a man under the Goſpel to marrie?
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:132715:19"/>Becauſe it ſeems they thought the profeſſion of the Goſpel ſuch a holy thing in old time (otherwiſe than Profeſſors do now,) that they thought it a kind of defilement to that ſpirituall and glorious profeſſion to marrie. That was one queſtion. Another was Chapter 7.4. Whether being married they might live with there husbands and wives as before, <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers that. They aske him againe, whether a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever being matched to an unbeliever, might turne away his wife, and leave his houſe? He anſwers that; Then the ſervants that were believers, and their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters unbelievers, they wrote, and asked whether they in conſcience ſhould ſeek their freedom? He anſwers that alſo. So there are divers queſtions from that place to the end of the Chapter; as whether it were lawfull for people to marrie in the time of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or for people that were once married to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie any more; he anſwers that. In the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter they have other ſorts of queſtions greater than theſe; Whether it were lawfull for believers to eat fleſh of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Idols? that was a great queſtion: for in thoſe Countries the Goſpel was among Infidels, and thoſe that were without they worſhipped the devill in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and ſacrificed meat to them; and this meat when it had been ſacrificed was carried to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and ſold: Now they queſtioned, whether they knowing that that meat was offered to an Idol, might eat of it? <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers that; And in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapters illuſtrates it, and ſo comes to ſumme up all his anſwers in theſe words, <hi>All things are lawfull for me, but all things are not expedient</hi> &amp;c. That is, the moſt of thoſe things that you have propoſed, if not all, they are lawfull, I ſay not they ſin if they marrie,

As if he ſhould ſay, I wonder why you <hi>Corinthians</hi> ask ſo many queſtions, whether this or that be lawfull; you may doe lawfull things, and yet damne your ſoules for ever. I will not hide the liberty of the Goſpel from you; It is lawfull to eat meat offered to an Idol: for, <hi>an Idol is nothing;</hi> and to marrie it is lawfull, ſo it be <hi>in the Lord:</hi> but yet in the New Teſtament you ſhould look higher than that which is lawfull, &amp; unlawfull, you ſhould look what is <hi>expedient,</hi> and what <hi>edifies,</hi> and thoſe things that doe not edifie, (as moſt of theſe things did not, though they were lawfull in themſelves,) you muſt not uſe them: for ſaith he in the verſe following, <hi>We ought not every man to ſeek his own things, but another mans good.</hi> So that I ſay the words are the ſumme of <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwer to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to theſe queſtions; you may finde the particular anſwers to every one of theſe queſtions, if you peruſe the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

                     <hi>The Saints under the new Teſtament, they are not ſo ſtrictly bound in point of LAWFULNES as the Saints were in the old Teſtament.</hi>

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:132715:22"/>
                  <p>The Second is this, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Saints under the new Teſtament, are as ſtrictly, or rather more ſtrictly bound, in point of expediency, than they were in the time of the old Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For you ſhall ſeldom read of <hi>expediency</hi> in the old Teſtament, but if a thing were lawfull, for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity they might doe it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you may learne this Leſſon, that</p>

                     <hi>If a Chriſtian will walk honourably, and ſpiritually as becometh the Goſpel, he muſt not onely (ſo much eye) what is LAWFULL, as what is EXPEDIENT.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe three things are taught here as I apprehend, in the words; And of theſe let me this day only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a little of the former: for you muſt take them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, you muſt not without wrong to your owne ſoules, and diſhonour to God, take one Doctrine, and not all; but heare all, and without prejudice compare all, and weigh, and try them.</p>

                  <p>Beloved, There is ſome truth in this, that you may apprehend preſently: for goe no further than theſe very queſtions that were here asked; It ſeemeth that in the <hi>old Teſtament</hi> all theſe things were not lawfull; it was not lawfull for them to eat all kind of fleſh, no
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:132715:22"/>fleſh that was defiled that was offered to Idols, it was not lawfull to eat; ſwines fleſh, and divers other things: Now, <hi>all things are lawfull; every creature of God is good.</hi> If they had unbelieving wives, ſtrange wives, <hi>Ezra 9. Nehem. 9.</hi> It was not lawfull to keep them, they muſt drive them away, and their children: but now it is lawfull for a man that hath an unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wife to remaine with her. I ſay, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that you preſently ſee, that the Saints in the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> in point of <hi>lawfulnes,</hi> are not ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and abſolutely bound up as they were in the <hi>Old.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will give you a few Scriptures, before I come to open it further. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt; take my yoke on you: for my yoke is eaſie, and my burthen is light.</hi> If you will give me leave to tell you my thoughts upon theſe words, I conceive that the meaning of it is this, that Chriſt Jeſus ſaw poore people trudging in the way to Heaven (as they thought) and every one thought to be ſaved in his own way and labour: as the Papiſts that do abundance of good works, &amp; by their own righteouſneſſe they will be ſaved: And there the poore <hi>Jews</hi> were under a yoke that <hi>they nor their fathers could beare;</hi> And by faſting and prayer they did ſtrive and ſtruggle, and all in vaine; Now, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary &amp; heavy laden.</hi> Now I ſay, (with ſubmiſſion) I think the meaning is not as we uſually take it, come to me all yee that are laden with <hi>ſin,</hi> and receive ſalvation, (though that be true) but yee that wearie your ſelves with the <hi>yoke and burthen</hi> of your <hi>own righteouſneſſe,</hi>

I will take away the rough yoke, and the heavie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that is on you, and I will give you an eaſie yoke, (as I ſhall ſhew anon) you ſhal have now ſaith Chriſt, an eaſier, and more comfortable way to Heaven than ever you thought of. Chriſt doth not onely pittie poore groſſe ſinners that are not in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but it pitties him to ſee men goe in odd wayes to Heaven; that labour, and goe about the buſh, and tire themſelves in their own waies, when there is an eaſie ſweet way that Jeſus Chriſt offers; <hi>Come unto me, for my yoke is eaſie, &amp; my burthen is light.</hi> That is, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect that we have more grace in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ent than there was in the Old,<note place="margin">More grace in the new Teſtament then in the Old.</note> (though that be true) but in it ſelfe, the way by Jeſus Chriſt, the way to Heaven, and ſalvation in obedience to Chriſt, is a lighter burden and an eaſier yoke, than the way that the Saints had (as it were) by works in the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that ſinners now have, that are out of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Finally my brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure; whatſoever things are of good report. If there be any love, if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things. Paul</hi> having taught them concerning things to be believed, matters of faith, he comes to matters of obedience; and now he makes a generall rule: as if he had ſaid, You are Saints of the New-Teſtament, and Chriſt hath made you an eaſie yoke; And it is not for me to deſcend much to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars for you: but I will make a generall rule, If you finde any thing that is <hi>true,</hi> any thing that is <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,</hi> any thing that is <hi>honourable,</hi> or <hi>venerable,</hi> any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:132715:23"/>thing that is <hi>lovely,</hi> or any thing that is of <hi>good report,</hi> if there be any <hi>vertue,</hi> or <hi>praiſe,</hi> think of thoſe things, lay hold on thoſe things; I will not tye you, but doe you ſpie them out; if there be any thing <hi>lovely,</hi> that makes the Goſpel of Chriſt <hi>prayſe worthy,</hi> or any thing that hath <hi>vertue,</hi> lay hold upon thoſe things; he ties them not to particulars: For they might ſay, a thing may be <hi>pure,</hi> and not <hi>lawfull</hi> it may be <hi>lovely,</hi> and <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable,</hi> and not <hi>lawfull;</hi> O, ſaith he, talk not of lawful,<note place="margin">Not to look ſo much to lawfulneſs as expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</note> you ſhould not walk ſo much by that rule, but if it be expedient and honour God, and adorne the Goſpel, lay hold on thoſe things, <hi>And whatſoever yee have ſeen me doe, that doe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will propoſe one place more, becauſe I deſire that you may underſtand this point, 2 <hi>Cor. 9.</hi> Where <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſhew them by his owne example, that it was not fit for them to look to lawful things only, but to what is expedient: for ſaith he, <hi>may I not lead about a Siſter as well as Peter,</hi> and others? May I not marrie as well as they? and live by my preaching as well as other men? Doth not the Law of God ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne?</hi> Yet I did none of theſe things, I did not marrie, nor take any thing for my paines of you <hi>Corinthians;</hi> why ſo? becauſe he might honour the Goſpel of Chriſt, and not looſe his glory in that: for, ſaith he, <hi>though I be free from all men, I make my ſelfe a ſervant to all, that I might gaine the more; to the Jews I become as a Jew, that I might gaine the Jewes, to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gaine them that are under the law, to them that are without law as without law, being not without law to God, I become every thing to all men, that by all meanes I might gaine ſome. Paul</hi> would be a <hi>Jew</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:132715:24"/>with the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and a <hi>Gentile</hi> with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he would be <hi>ſtrong</hi> with the <hi>ſtrong,</hi>

                        <hi>Pauls</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.</note> and <hi>weak</hi> with the <hi>weak;</hi> how could he complie thus to win and ſave ſoules, unleſſe there were a latitude given by Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is a liberty that is not determined, and the Saints may apply themſelves to, for the glory of God and the good of others? But <hi>Paul</hi> he was not <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out law to God;</hi> that is, in his ſoule and ſpirit he did keep cloſe to God. And not only ſo, but in externals where God had determined: for he would not ſin to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plie with men: but it ſeems things were not much determined, when <hi>Paul</hi> could be a <hi>Jew</hi> with the <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Gentile</hi> with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as if he had not known the <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp; as he ſaith, <hi>catch them by guile.</hi> Not as a cunning abominable creature, but he could be wiſe &amp; politick for the glory of God, &amp; the good of others; he could be a <hi>weak</hi> profeſſor with the <hi>weake,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong</hi> with the <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and be circumciſed, and ſhave his head; and when he was among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> he could ſhew his freedome, and win them; he could be <hi>all things to all men,</hi> which he could not have been, if there had not been a latitude in the Goſpel, that people may uſe for the glory of God, and the good of others. So that we have now the leſſon, the truth proved.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Beloved,<note place="margin">not in the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,</note> you are to underſtand that the morall Law of God, that is, the ten words, as God calls it, the ten commandments, with the ſpirituall expoſition of it, through the booke of God: God hath not given us more ſcope, &amp; libertie in theſe, than he did to them, if ſo much. As, <hi>thou ſhalt not ſteale; thou ſhalt not commit adulterie; thou ſhalt not take the name of God in vaine:</hi> God doth not give us leave now to cozen, and ſweare, and ſteale, and be filthy: this is not the meaning, you are bound as much to this, as ever they were.</p>
                  <p>Only take that with this exception,<note place="margin">So bound to obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, though the curſe be gone.</note> that if you be Saints and borne againe new creatures, you are bound to doe this [I ſhall ſhew upon what grounds and motives anon] but the curſe, and plague, and damnation that ſhould ſeize on you, and that was to ſeize upon them that went to be ſaved by it, that is remooved. and gone. <hi>There is no damnation to them that are in Chriſt.</hi> But the thing it ſelfe ſtands firme, Chriſt came not to <hi>deſtroy the law, but to eſtabliſh it;</hi> heaven and earth ſhall paſſe, but not one iot or tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it ſhall paſſe.<note place="margin">The Law the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, &amp; the Spirit the inward rule.</note> I could ſhew may the law of God is the outward rule, and the ſpirit the inward rule; and theſe are not contrarie one to another as men uſually make them. Theſe rules are the ſame to the Saints in the new Teſtament as well as in the old: and as a Saint under the old Teſtament was a Saint under the Goſpel, as it were: ſo in the times of the Goſpel, a ſinner one that is not borne againe is under the law, and under the curſe, and damnation of it at this day. So, this libertie, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:132715:25"/>latitude it lies not at all in the morall law of God, thoſe commands of God thoſe laſt for ever there is no gap opened there.</p>
                  <p>Wherein then is it:</p>
                  <p>It in theſe two things principally:<note place="margin">The liberty of Sts. in the new-Teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ent.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>One is that now we are freed from all thoſe <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> that lay upon them under the law; in the new Teſtament we are freed from them. I need not name many places.<note place="margin">Freedome from Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> In <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. compared with verſe 13. <hi>Standfaſt in the libertie wherewith Chriſt hath made you free, and be not brought back into bondage.</hi> What is that? be not circumciſed, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is taken divers times for all the ceremoniall law; <hi>you obſerve daies, and times, and moneths, and years, I am afraid of you.</hi> Chriſt hath made us free from all the ceremonies of the law.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay that it is a poore freedome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A great freedome.</note>You are miſtaken; it is a great thing: for if you looke Act. 15. the Apoſtles and Elders there ſay of the ceremonies, <hi>neither we nor our fathers were able to beare them,</hi> they were ſo heavie. For if we conſider the coſt they were at, how they were driven to kill beeves, and ſheep, and oxen, and to make morning, and evening ſacrifice, and burnt offrings, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſo much money, to be at abundance of coſt, and charges, and to goe to Ieruſalem every yeare, and to a ſacrifice in the Temple, and a great deale of labour; And which is more, there were abundance of ceremoniall reſtraints; their places they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to them; they muſt worſhip in this place, and not in another: but now in the Goſpel, we muſt <hi>lift up pure hands in every place.</hi> And then, for the time they had dayes, and moneths, and they had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:132715:25"/>yeares of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> which are all gone; And for the very creatures, they muſt have ſuch meat, and ſuch cloathes; they were reſtrained, and tied in every thing, and croſſed that they could not have their minde; If you conſider this, it is a great matter that Chriſt Jeſus hath at once removed all theſe <hi>beggerly rudiments</hi> away: ſo I ſay, there is ſo much more roome for you, that unleſſe Popiſh Moſaicall ſpirits bring them in againe, Chriſt Jeſus hath removed them. That is one thing.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, and the chiefe is this,<note place="margin">2. Libery in in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternalls of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> That there is a greater liberty in reſpect of the <hi>externalls</hi> of Gods Worſhip; that is, that God hath not tied people in the new Teſtament ſo ſtricly to his outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as he did the people in the Old; I doe not meane that he hath not tied them for the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> or for the <hi>matter</hi> of it;<note place="margin">Nor in the ſubſtence or matter, or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner.</note> neither doe I meane (to ſpeak properly) that he hath not tied them for the <hi>manner;</hi> but for <hi>circumſtance;</hi> and ſome circumſtances too, it may be, God hath tied us to. So I meane not matter ſo much as manner, nor properly the manner ſo much as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; nor all circumſtances: for it may be there are ſome that God hath inſtituted and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but there are abundance of circumſtances in the worſhip of God, that are undetermined in his bleſſed Word, and are left to the ſpirituall diſcretion of the Saints, to determine, as may agree moſt with love, and peace, and charity. As you may ſee clearly,<note place="margin">Punctuall lawes in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</note> if you compare the one with the other, the outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in the old Teſtament, and in the New, you ſhall ſee for their outward worſhip there, they were tied to the ſnuffe of a candle, there muſt be ſo many loopes, and ſo many pins, and ſo many ilet
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:132715:26"/>holes.<note place="margin">Paſſeover.</note> Nay, come to the <hi>paſſeover,</hi> you ſhall ſee the Lord made them divers laws; as they muſt take a lambe of ſuch a yeare, &amp; on ſuch a day of the moneth, and what kind of lambe it muſt be, and he ſhews them what they ſhall doe with the lambe, how they muſt kill it, and what their poſture muſt be, they muſt ſtand and have their ſtaves in their hands: and what ſauce they muſt have, and how they ſhall roaſt it, and what they muſt doe with the reſt of it. The Lord did punctually binde them, and ſtint them in that &amp; other things, the Lord made all his lawes deare to them. But in the new Teſtament, take the chiefe of the holy Ordinances, <hi>the Supper of the Lord,</hi> we ſee Chriſt when he was betrayed,<note place="margin">Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> he took bread and wine, ſaying, <hi>This is my body, and this is my blood,</hi> and there is an end. You may ask five hundred queſtions if you will, what bread it was? and what wine? and how oft it was taken by the Diſciples, or adminiſtred, but there you heare no further of it.</p>
                  <p>And ſo for <hi>Baptiſme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Baptiſme.</note> it is ſaid, <hi>John baptized in Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi> as if it had been known before, though it were never heard of. And the Diſciples when they were to preach after the reſurrection, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Goe preach, he that beleeves and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved. Go, baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and there was an end. They might ask a hundred queſtions, Shall we doe it in a River, or in a Brook? to young, or to old? in Winter, or in Summer? Who ſhall doe it? and what ſhall his calling be? and many ſuch queſtions: but Chriſt layes down the ſumme of the Doctrine, and the end of it, <hi>In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and there is no more of it.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:132715:26"/>
                  <p>And ſo for <hi>Offices,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Offices and Officers.</note> and <hi>Officers</hi> in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For Offices, you have a lite or two of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and Preachers, and Deacons, and two or three lines of his duty, and this is all, a briefe touch, and there is an end. Now doe you think that the Sonne of God in the new and glorious Teſtament, would paſſe over theſe things out of careleſneſſe? Or did he ſlight it, as if he cared not how it were done? Might not he have made his Supper as curious as the Paſſeover, and all thoſe ordinances? He might. But to me there are many clear reaſons why he left it ſo: among the reſt this is one, that in the new Teſtament the Saints are not ſo ſtrictly, and ſo ſtraitly bound, as they of the old were.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay,<note place="margin">Why Chriſt hath left the Saints now at more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</note> How doth it appeare that it was ſo? Why did Jeſus Chriſt leave it thus? Why did he not binde us hand and foot as they were?</p>
                  <p>There are theſe foure or ſive reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this is one reaſon that the Apoſtle hath, why Chriſt gave this liberty; becauſe they in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament were <hi>Servants,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. The Saints under the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament are ſonnes, under the old they were ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</note> as it were; and we under the new Teſtament are <hi>Sonnes.</hi> You ſhall read, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1. that <hi>the heire as long as he is a childe, differs not from a ſervant.</hi> What is the reaſon that <hi>Paul</hi> calls them <hi>Servants?</hi> You ſhall ſee afterwards, that they being ſervants, were tied to ſuch burdens and rules. You expect from a ſonne more care than from a ſervant, and that a ſonne ſhould doe more for your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage than a ſervant. But here is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſonne and a ſervant, you will not lay ſuch burdens on a ſonne as on a ſervant. And you tell a ſervant every day how he ſhall doe every thing one after another, and call him to account; this is the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:132715:27"/>condition of a ſervant: But to a ſonne you onely ſay, Walk honorably, and as becomes your ſelfe, do ſome good, be imployed, be not idle. A ſonne looks to his buſineſſe, and honours his father more though he be not tied. It is baſe to tie a ſon as much as a ſervant. So we being now to be ſonnes, truly and really, the Lord hath given us a larger liberty.</p>
                  <p>Another thing is this,<note place="margin">2. The Saints then were children under tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the Saints now as men in years.</note> that they were ſonnes too, (though they were as ſervants) but they were in their <hi>minority,</hi> they were <hi>under Tutors and Governours, till the time appointed of the Father;</hi> and being ſo, they were in bondage: they were little children as it were in their coats, and we are grown ſtrong, <hi>grown men</hi> to <hi>full age.</hi> We are as men in ripe yeares, but they in the old Teſtament were little children (as it were:) you know you muſt make lawes for little children: you ſay to a little childe, take heed of a knife, that you do not cut your fingers; take heed that you doe not goe over the threſhold, or over a bridge, or neare the fire, or the water, leſt you fall in; and you have lawes how he ſhall doe every thing: but when this childe is grown up to twenty or foure and twenty yeares, is it not a ſhamefull thing that a man ſhould tie ſuch a ſonne, and ſay, goe not over the threſhold, unleſſe you ask leave, nor take a knife in your hand? &amp;c. No, we break thoſe little lawes, and diſſolve them by degrees, as the childe growes up to yeares. So when we were grown to full yeares, as we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, the Lord Jeſus hath broken and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved thoſe little childiſh lawes, thoſe <hi>beggerly Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments:</hi> thoſe A. B. C. lawes and accidences wet for children, the child is led by the ſleeve, and reads with a feskew: the Lord hath broken theſe, and the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:132715:27"/>reaſon is good that theſe ſhould be diſſolved, and the people of God ſhould not be tied as when they were children.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. The Saints under the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament have more of the Spirit.</note> another reaſon is this, that the Saints under the new Teſtament were to have more of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> to teach them within what is the will of God, and what is for the glory of God; therefore they have leſſe need of teaching by externall things. A word to the wiſe is enough; the wiſer a man is, the leſſe you need to beat things into his head, to ſay you muſt turn at this corner and at that: to a foole you ſay, you muſt doe this, and doe that; but if it be a wiſe man that hath brains in his head, you tell him his meſſage, and there is an end. So they were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſilly, and things muſt be beaten into their heads, and they muſt be told every meeting, and every turning. But in the Goſpel God hath promiſed to poure out his Spirit, as it is, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. <hi>I will poure out my Spirit upon all fleſh.</hi> And in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8. In the new Covenant it ſhall not be as in the dayes of old. What is the difference? Then <hi>every man did teach his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> but it ſhall not be ſo now, but <hi>they ſhall be all taught of God, from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Moſt of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the old Teſtament by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means.</note> The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is this, they in the old Teſtament had little knowledge but what they got by outward meanes; therefore they were to write the law of God upon their walles, and upon their poſts, and to ſpeake of it when they did ſit down, and when they roſe up, and thoſe that had moſt parts, and breeding, and learning, and moſt knowledge in the Scriptures, they were the knowingeſt men: but now <hi>they ſhall not every man teach his neighbour.</hi> Not but that it is lawfull for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to help another; but the meaning is this,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:132715:28"/>that moſt of their knowledge ſhall not come by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward externall wayes: But, ſaith God, <hi>I will poure out abundance of my Spirit, and they ſhall all know me from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> Therefore we ſee in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. that <hi>John</hi> himſelfe being accounted, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, the moſt ſpirituall Apoſtle of all, <hi>Little Children</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you have an anointing, and I need not teach you. John</hi> would not take upon him to teach them, they had ſo much of the Spirit. Therefore under the new Teſtament the Lord having appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to poure out abundance of his Spirit upon his people, he thinks it unfit to goe and make ſuch end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe lawes as were in the old Teſtament. Now the Spirit of God doth not onely teach us what is the will of God, and the mind of Chriſt in things <hi>lawfull,</hi> but in things that were <hi>undetermined,</hi> that were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawfull nor unlawfull; the holy Ghoſt teacheth us what is <hi>expedient,</hi> and what is not: and thou haſt as much need of the Spirit of God to ſhew thee that which is <hi>expedient</hi> and <hi>inexpedient,</hi> as to know the will of God, and the rule what is <hi>lawfull,</hi> and what is <hi>unlawfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. God would ſet up a ſpirituall kingdome in the new Teſtament.</note> if you would know why Chriſt hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a larger latitude and liberty in externall things, to the Saints now, than to them, it is, becauſe the Lords purpoſe and deſigne was, under the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, to ſet up a <hi>ſpirituall kingdome:</hi> all the old things, the ſervices and offerings in the old law, were but ſignes and ſhadowes of ſpirituall worſhip. <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within;</hi> propheſying of the Saints in the new Teſtament, that their glory ſhould be chiefly &amp; mainly in inward graces. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as in the old Teſtament there is a great deale of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:132715:28"/>
                     <hi>externall worſhip</hi> laid down in every leafe, but the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi> was <hi>vailed</hi> and covered: ſo in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in every leafe, and line almoſt, the <hi>ſpirituall worſhip</hi> is ſet down in the ſerving of God and Chriſt and the <hi>outward</hi> in a ſort is <hi>vayled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now you know by experience how hard it is to break a cuſtome, if we be but 20 or 40 years accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to a thing,<note place="margin">Cuſteme hardly broken.</note> it is hard to break it. How hard is it to break a drunkard of his cuſtome? as hard as to <hi>waſh a Blackmore white.</hi> Now this people being a cuſtomed foure thouſand yeares to ſerve God with offerings, and ſacrifice, and Temple, and Jeruſalem, it was not eaſie to breake them of that cuſtome. Therefore the Lord Chriſt comes, and when hee would ſet up his worſhip, he ſpeaks exceeding fairly of that outward worſhip, becauſe they had fed ſo long upon it, that they doted, As we at this day (as they) would make a curious outward worſhip: as of old, they wrung and wreſted the Scripture to make it faire, and delicate, and curious, as that that God would have of them.</p>
                  <p>But Chriſts deſigne being to ſet up a ſpirituall kingdome, he ſhewes, that as in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſſe there were ſomething <hi>internall,</hi> the <hi>externall</hi> did not pleaſe God, <hi>My ſoule abhorres your ſacrifices, &amp;c.</hi> So in the new Teſtament much more, the Lord doth not regard <hi>outward</hi> worſhip at all, without the <hi>inward;</hi> and the <hi>inward</hi> is almoſt all that God looks after. Therefore conſider a few pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. There was great queſtion about ceremonies and outward things, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Neither circumciſion availeth any thing, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncircumciſion, but faith that worketh by love. For in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:132715:29"/>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſaith he, that is, in the dayes of Chriſt, in the new Teſtament, <hi>neither circumciſion nor uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion avails,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Externals to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to as for as God hath let them down</note> 
                     <hi>but faith that worketh by love.</hi> Talk not of outward things, ſtand not ſo much upon them, (not but that the ſervants of God muſt look to externals, as farre as God hath ſet them down, but talk not ſo much of them) but <hi>faith that worketh by love,</hi> ſee there be that. So in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. the ſame words almoſt: <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, or uncircumciſion, but a new creature.</hi> In the time of Chriſt he lookes not whether men be <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,</hi> or <hi>uncircumciſed,</hi> but whether they be <hi>new creatures.</hi> So in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. there are the ſame words almoſt: The Apoſtle poynts out unto us how much God in the time of the new Teſtament, regards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip. Therefore we ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. where there was great controverſie concerning the eating of hearbs, and the keeping of dayes; <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers not directly, but ſaith, <hi>The kingdome of God is not in theſe things, but in righteouſnes and peace and ioy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> He would not have them ſtrive about theſe things, but goe to the inward worſhip; ſee that there be <hi>righteouſnes, and peace and ioy in the holy Ghoſt:</hi> ſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. when there was claſhing about theſe outward things; <hi>It is a good thing</hi> [ſaith he] <hi>that the heart be ſtabliſhed with grace.</hi> And ſo in Timothy; <hi>bodily excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe profitteth little, but godlines is profitable for all things.</hi> Therfore. The deſigne of God, being to ſet up a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall kingdome, the work of grace in the heart, that we might worſhip him in ſpirit, the lord hath given more libertie, and is more ſparing in laying downe of externall worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this is another reaſon [though I could give
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:132715:29"/>many more] that the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt was to be preached to <hi>all nations</hi> &amp; they being <hi>different</hi> in <hi>cuſtomes</hi> in <hi>clymates</hi> in <hi>conſtitution,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel being to bee preached to different nations, Chriſt ties them chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that ſubſtance.</note> and <hi>diſpoſitions</hi> Chriſt tied them in his law for the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> ſo left the reſt to be by the ſpirit of God in his people, to be determined according to the beſt advantage for the honour of God, and the good of his people. As for inſtance, it is a hard thing to make a law for all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and for all the Counties and Townes, that that ſhould be good for one Countie that is for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and for one Towne that is for another. But if a man were to make a law for <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Turkie</hi> &amp; for all the world, that are nations croſſe, and contrary one to another, in their <hi>clymate</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition;</hi> that law that were good for one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome would deſtroy another. So here, when Chriſt made lawes in the old Teſtament, there was but one nation, and a little nation, and the Goſpel was not to remove from that nation; Therefore he comes to particulars, but the Goſpel now being to be preached to all nations, he hath left a latitude for his people, that they may apply the Goſpel, to all countries and nations for the glory of God, and the good of his people.</p>
                  <p>As for inſtance,<note place="margin">Baptiſme,</note> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Baptize all nations,</hi> that is, go and uſe water for their waſhing) for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men find in the word, I ſpeak not of now) go uſe water for a ſpirituall end, to purge their bodies, to ſignifie the purging of the ſoule. If Chriſt had tied men to go into <hi>Jordan,</hi> as in that countrie it was ſo hote, they might goe with a great deale of comfort: but if Chriſt had made Baptiſme ſuch an Ordinance, as that in all <hi>Climates,</hi> and <hi>Countries,</hi> and <hi>Regions,</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:132715:30"/>they muſt go over head and eares in a <hi>River;</hi> we know in ſome climates it would have been preſent death; As with us in this climate, at ſome times of the yeare to be put over head and eares in the <hi>Thames</hi> it would be death, at others not. Therefore Chriſt layes down the ſubſtance, and the end; and by the Word of God and ſound Preaching, he left the reſt for the Spirit of God, in his people to apply.</p>
                  <p>Againe, to inſtance in the <hi>Supper of the Lord;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Lords Supper.</note> The Lord <hi>tooke bread and wine, and bleſſed, and broke, and gave them;</hi> and the drift of all the buſines is to ſhew the <hi>breaking</hi> of his <hi>body,</hi> and the <hi>ſhedding</hi> of his <hi>blood;</hi> Now, he hath bound us that we ſhould break bread, and drink wine, that may repreſent the thing: but he hath not bound us to <hi>bread</hi> ſo properly called, or to <hi>wine</hi> properly ſo called: for there are ſome countries that have neither <hi>bread</hi> nor <hi>wine,</hi> but only rootes that they called bread, and they have water for their drink; Now, if Chriſt had ſaid it muſt be true bread, and true, and reall <hi>wine,</hi> that muſt doe the deed, theſe people could never have the Supper of the Lord: Therefore the Goſpel being not to be limitted to one countrie, but to be ſpread to many nations, Chriſt hath left a latitude for the conveniency of all nations. So you have the Doctrine, and the Reaſons of it. I ſhould come to the Uſes; but I muſt leave them for another day.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement for ſinners to come to Chriſt.</note>If there be ſuch a latitude in the wayes of Chriſt in the Goſpel; Then here is a ſweet encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all poore ſinners to come to Chriſt; It is his owne Uſe that hee makes, <hi>Come unto me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Yeé that are wearie, and heavie laden, and I will give you reſt: for my yoke is eaſie, and my burthen is light.</hi> Beloved, Chriſt pities thee, not only that thou doſt not goe to heaven, but that thou goeſt with a bundle upon thy back: Chriſt would have thee come in an eaſie ſweete way. As for inſtance here are ſome that have gone on fortie, or fiftie yeares, that have kept Faſts, and gone to Church, and prayed norning and evening, and have wept, and howled, and a great deale of labour; Now if you come to Jeſus Chriſt, and receive him, thou ſhalt finde not only a ſtraight, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way, but a way unſpeakably ſweet and eaſie.</p>
                  <p>This makes many a man that he runnes from Chriſt and abhors the profeſſion of Religion,<note place="margin">Why men run from Chriſt.</note> becauſe he lookes upon it as a harſh thing. O, if I be religious, I muſt not drink, I muſt not ſmile; it is a melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mopiſh thing, I ſhall be bound hand and foot, I will never be tied with ſuch a chaine; as one ſaid, if I be Religious I muſt not dare to drink a pot of beere with a neighbour: ſo; looking on the wayes of Chriſt as hard, that will take away all libertie, that they ſhall be meere ſlaves, they are afraid of it.</p>
                  <p>In Ioh 6. Chriſt teacheth them, you muſt <hi>eat my
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:132715:31"/>fleſh, and drink my blood.</hi> If they had underſtood it, it was a ſweet doctrine; but they ſaid <hi>This is a hard ſaying</hi> and ſo they ran from Chriſt. They thought it had, they would be no <hi>Caniballs;</hi> and away they went, by a miſapprehenſion of the wayes of God. So this is one thing that keeps men from Chriſt, an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the wayes of God are melancholly, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, and will ſo reſtraine them that they ſhall have no comfort.</p>
                  <p>But herein thou art deceived: for as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>O Lord, thy commandments are exceeding broad.</hi> The wayes of God are broad in this reſpect, (though they be narrow in other reſpects) it is a ſweet way. This I averre, that it is the generall block that keeps men from godlines, either the Miniſters preſenting the wayes of God in a grim manner makes them fearfull, or peoples miſapprehending them in their owne fancie, and through temptation, though the Miniſter preſent them right.<note place="margin">Miniſters lay ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling blocks that keep men from Chriſt.</note> And uſulaly they lay ſuch blocks in the doore and threſhold of the Goſpel; There are ſo many contradictions, a man muſt be <hi>broaken,</hi> and <hi>humbled,</hi> and <hi>damned</hi> almoſt, and goe by the gates of Hell before he can come to Chriſt. We ſay ſtumbling blocks in the way that people cannot come in; and when they are come in, there are ſo many that faſten burthens on them, that poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſee it almoſt impoſſible to get in; and when they are in, it is a very <hi>Priſon.</hi> This makes them that they will not come to Chriſt, and ſo looſe their ſoules poore wretches But when thou commeſt to Chriſt, thou commeſt not to a <hi>Priſon,</hi> as thou conceiveſt. Our work is to <hi>preach the Goſpel;</hi> What is that?<note place="margin">To preach the Goſpel what.</note> to goe tell <hi>glad tidings;</hi> What is that? To tell you that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:132715:32"/>
                     <hi>ſalvation</hi> is given by Chriſt, that he hath laid down his life; and not only ſo, that you ſhal have ſalvation: but it is glad tidings becauſe, we offer you a <hi>better ſervice,</hi> if you will come in; that whereas now you are under the devill, and your own <hi>works,</hi> and in a way to damne your ſelves, if you will come to Chriſt you ſhall have not only <hi>ſalvation,</hi> but a <hi>ſweet ſervice,</hi> He will make you <hi>Princes</hi> with him. Therefore ſee the language that God puts into our mouthes when he ſends us to preach; he ſends us not to hire <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:</hi> for that Parable is to another end; we are not ſent to get <hi>Gally-ſlaves</hi> to the Oares, or a <hi>Beare</hi> to the ſtake:<note place="margin">Miniſters to wooe men as Spouſes for Chriſt.</note> but he ſends us to wooe you as <hi>ſpouſes,</hi> to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie you to Chriſt; and in wooing there muſt not be <hi>harſh</hi> dealing; and when a man hath wooed and got a wife ſhe muſt be <hi>kindly</hi> uſed, and not <hi>harſhly;</hi> ſhe hath much freedome, otherwiſe than when ſhe was a <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and a <hi>drudge.</hi> So, we come not as to ſervants, you ſhall be wives of Jeſus Chriſt, you ſhall have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Chriſt, &amp;c all in him ſhall be yours. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider this poore ſoules that lie dead in ſins; wee are ſent to adopt you, to be ſons to God, and ſpouſes to Chriſt. Nay, we are to invite you to a <hi>Feaſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Siners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to a Feaſt.</note> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. <hi>And the fatlings, and all things are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> Now, when men come to a Feaſt, when friends are invited to a Feaſt, we doe not make lawes on them preſently: but ſay, I pray Sir call for wine, or <hi>what you will:</hi> So if there be lawes in a Feaſt, they be lawes of pleaſure, and joy, and not otherwiſe; and though their be lawes of civillity, yet there is liberty, and ſweetnes, there is no law that reſtraines true comfort there. We come to call you to a Feaſt, not only in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but the <hi>wayes</hi> of Chriſt are a continuall <hi>Feaſt</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:132715:32"/>in this world, Gods way is ſweet; and if you will come to Chriſt, you ſhall not only goe to heaven and be Saints there; but the way is unſpeakably ſweet. Think of this; I dare ſay, you have had ſtrange odd thoughts of the wayes of God, that hath kept many of you from Chriſt; pray to the Lord to preſent theſe wayes to you truly; and you will not ſtand out.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſweet place in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>I am the doore</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>If any come to me,<note place="margin">Chriſt a door how.</note> he ſhall goe in and out, and finde paſture.</hi> I am the <hi>doore:</hi> But ſome may ſay, wee love not to goe in at ſuch a doore, unleſſe wee know when it is locked, and when it is nor. No, ſaith he, I am not a doore that hath locks and bolts, that will bring you into ſtraits; but I am a doore that you ſhall <hi>goe in and out, and finde paſture for your ſoules.</hi> His meaning is not you ſhall play faſt and looſe, and if you come in to Chriſt to day, you ſhall goe out to the devill to morrow: but it is a figurative ſpeech. That Chriſt is not a doore that pens men up, but there is the liberty of a field, there is ſpaciouſnes and comfort, and libertie; thou ſhalt not be tied and bound up, as thou and I a long while were under Hell. Conſider this, you that have hard thoughts of the wayes of God, and have been flow in comming to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But to open this a little. Some man may ſay.</p>
                  <p>You ſay Sir that the wayes of Jeſus Chriſt if they be rightly preſented to me,<note place="margin">The wayes of Chriſt eaſie.</note> they are eaſie and ſweet and comfortable, and there is no ſuch hardneſſe in them, how doth that appeare?</p>
                  <p>It will appeare by theſe foure things breifly.</p>

Therefore we are ſent to preach to Goſpel, that is to tell you glad tydings that all is done to your hands, to invite you to a feaſt: ſee what feaſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 22 to tell you that <hi>the fatlings are ſlayne, and dinner is readie, and all things are prepared,</hi> being neither bottle, nor basket If you will come to Chriſt rightly, Chriſt doth not accept that thou ſhouldeſt doe the leaſt thing to ſave thy ſoule, he hath died, and ſaved it and he bids us tell thee ſo.</p>
                  <p>O therefore, Who would be a drunkard, and a wretch, and ſtand as a ſot mopeing all the yeare, and not come to Chriſt? The Goſpel is like the ſheet <hi>Act.</hi> 10. that was full of foules, and of all kind of meat, and there comes a voyce, <hi>ariſe Peter and eat,</hi> there was nothing elſe to be done; So thou muſt not come and we ſet thee in a way to get Heaven, and life; but the ſheet is let down, here is life, and ſalvation, and ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt; only, <hi>ariſe, and eat:</hi> only <hi>love</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> for it. Here it is true as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>One ſoweth, and another reapeth;</hi> Chriſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:132715:33"/>hath ſowed everlaſting happineſſe, only come thou into the harveſt and reape.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay: (for ſome of you are apt to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) are not duties of Religion, <hi>Preaching,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hearing,</hi> and <hi>Praying,</hi> meanes of everlaſting ſalvation, and yet you ſay, if wee will come to Chriſt there is nothing to be done for ſalvation, but all is done by Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Beloved, that you may underſtand this,<note place="margin">Duties meanes of ſalvation.</note> and not ſtumble, know that duties may be ſaid to be meanes two wayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <list>
                        <item>Properly, or</item>
                        <item>Improperly;</item>
                     </list> That is thus; <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Hearing,</hi> and <hi>Faſting,</hi> and all thoſe things are meanes, that is, they doe not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and properly procure everlaſting life, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for that is falſe, they are not meanes ſo; the Papiſts make them ſo, If you ſhould heare a Jeſuite; he would ſay that <hi>peregrinations</hi> and <hi>Faſtings,</hi> and theſe things are the way to ſave your ſouls: this is Poperie. But duties and religious performances are meanes improperly, that is thus, they doe not procure ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only the blood of Chriſt doth that: if we mix any thing elſe with it, we make it vaine: But they are meanes, that is, they are <hi>conduit pipes</hi> through which the comfort, and benefit of all that Chriſt hath done for thee, comes to thy ſoule; ſo they are meanes: if thou come in, thou ſhalt have them as conduit pipes to reveale and convey thoſe things every day: but in a proper ſenſe they are not meanes of ſalvation: for that, (to ſpeake properly) is only the death and merit of Chriſt. Therfore, this is one thing to incour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age thee, that if thou now heare the Preacher invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to come to Chriſt, learne one thing more
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:132715:34"/>then thou diddeſt before, there is not a jot for thee to doe for thy ſalvation, but take it as done to thy hands; beleive it, and love God and Chriſt, that gave it: there is nothing elſe to be done, world without end in that ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, thou wilt ſay, is there nothing to be done?</p>
                  <p>Yes, for other ends that the Goſpel ſpecifies, that thou maieſt <hi>adorne</hi> thy profeſſion, and <hi>be like Chriſt,</hi> and ſerve him in thy generation, and <hi>honnor</hi> him in this world.</p>
                  <p>But marke,<note place="margin">Thoſe things that are left for us to doe are few &amp; eaſie.</note> even thoſe things they are but very few in compariſon of other things; they are not ſo many, nor ſo great, and greivous: <hi>The comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dments of Chriſt are not greivous,</hi> ſaith <hi>John.</hi> But to open this briefly,<note place="margin">Chriſts way eaſie, compared.</note> If you paralell, and compare them with foure ſorts of people, or foure ſorts of wayes; you ſhall ſee the eaſieneſs of Chriſts commands.</p>
                  <p>As firſt,<note place="margin">1. With the ſervice of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> If wee paralell the ſervice of God (I mean under the Goſpel) with the ſervice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Saints under the old Teſtament. I told you what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſervices, and paines, and coſt they were at: you know what paines and coſt there was in the building of the Tabernacle, and the Temple, if you looke upon particulars: and what coſt it was to offer ſacrifices twice a day; what a charge it was to bring Oxen and ſheep, and what a drudgerie to goe up to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and how they were croſſed in their time, and their meat and their clothes. It was a burthen that <hi>neither wee, nor our fathers could bears,</hi> ſay the Apoſtles, &amp; Elders <hi>Act.</hi> 10.15. Not only in reſpect of mans corruption, but the thing it ſelf was exceeding heavier but the moſt of thoſe things are done away in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:132715:34"/>
                  <p>Secondly, if we paralell it with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> religion,<note place="margin">2. With the ſervice of Papiſts.</note> when thou commeſt to Poperie, if thou be a Papiſt there are endleſſe commands; thou muſt <hi>faſt</hi> ſo oft in a weeke, thou muſt obſerve ſo many <hi>holy-dayes,</hi> and <hi>eves,</hi> and <hi>whipp,</hi> and ſcourge thy ſelf, and goe in <hi>pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinations;</hi> There is none of this traſh in the ſervice of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Then paralell it with the ſervice of <hi>naturall</hi> men,<note place="margin">3. With the ſervice of naturall men.</note> that goe (as it were) by their own righteouſneſſe to ſave themſelves; It is a hard labour, and a rough way, they muſt keep <hi>every</hi> commandment of God, if they miſs one, they are damned for ever. Here it is not ſo, the curſe is taken away; In thoſe few things thou art to do for Chriſt, if thou faile, there is no damnation; the hell and curſe is gone.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Compare it with the ſervice of the <hi>devill,</hi> that all men naturall are in;<note place="margin">4. With the ſervice of the devill.</note> you ſhall ſee that in the ſervice of the devill, there is abundance of charge, and coſt, and paines. As for inſtance, if you look to a <hi>drunkard,</hi> he ſpends the whole weeke, and waſtes his eſtate in the ſervice of the devill. The <hi>adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer</hi> doth not ceaſe to ſin; the devill will not give him reſt. And the <hi>worlding</hi> drudgeth all his life to ſerve the devill. The ſervice of the devill is a great ſlavery, and drudgery; that a Saint often pities a carnall man, not only for the <hi>danger</hi> of his ſoule, but for the <hi>drudgery</hi> of his life; he pities a worldly man, to ſee him <hi>riſe early, and goe to bed late;</hi> As we ſay, he muſt needs goe that the devil drives. The devil drives the drunkard to the alehouſe, and the worlding to his mammon; and eates out the ſtrength and marrow of his bones. It is not ſo in the ſervice of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object, </seg>
                     </label> the ſervice of the devill is ſweet,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:132715:35"/>wee ſee men continue to be his ſervants,<note place="margin">Men finde ſweetnes in the ſervice of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</note> and will not be the ſervants of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I could ſpeak many things of that, but only a word.<note place="margin">1. It will one day be ſoure.</note> It ſeemeth ſweet to men: But it will be ſoure one day.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, though it be ſweet to them,<note place="margin">2. That ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is from diſtemper.</note> yet it is a ſweetnes that ariſeth from their <hi>ſicknes</hi> and <hi>diſtemper.</hi> As a child e that will eate no meat ſometimes, but coles and aſhes: it is ſweet, but it is a diſtemper: he is ſicke, there is no ſuch ſweetneſs in coales. And a man in a feaver, he deſireth to drink water, it is but his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; So if wee be <hi>drunk,</hi> and <hi>ſweare,</hi> and be <hi>whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moungers,</hi> and <hi>proud</hi> men and women, and delight in <hi>worldly</hi> things, in pleaſures, and the ſervice of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; it is an evil humour, and corruption that makes us finde that ſweetneſs.</p>
                  <p>But the maine reaſon is this,<note place="margin">3. It is ſweet becauſe you never taſted the ſweetns of Chriſts ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> you find <hi>ſweetnes</hi> in the ſervice of the devill, becauſe you never <hi>taſted</hi> the <hi>goodnes</hi> of the <hi>ſervice of Chriſt.</hi> I dare ſay; if there were no heaven, nor hell, if thou diddeſt know the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and comfort in the ſervice of Chriſt, thou wouldeſt ſcorne, and diſdaine, to ſeeke comfort in a cup of drink, or in worldly things: but that is the reaſon, thou haſt not <hi>taſted that the Lord is gracious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I remember a godly, bleſſed man, that when carn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all men made bonefites, and the miniſters would have reproved them to ſee what a ſtir they made on a <hi>Candlemas Even:</hi> let them alone ſaith he; that is all the comfort they have; they have noe acquaintance with better comforts if they had, they would leave them. So he was readie to weepe for their joy. So the pleaſure, and comfort thou haſt in the ſervice of the devill (the Lord pittie thee) it is only becauſe thou
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:132715:35"/>art not acquainted with the ſweetnes of the wayes of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>If you object, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> I but ſome of the <hi>ſervants</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> have turned the <hi>ſervants</hi> of the <hi>aevill</hi> againe.<note place="margin">Some of Chriſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have gone back to ſerve the devill.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer; they are but <hi>few,</hi> there are more of the devills ſervants that become the ſervants of Chriſt than of the ſervants of Chriſt that become the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the devill. But thoſe people that do ſo,<note place="margin">1. They are but few.</note> they are but <hi>wooden leggs</hi> they never drew ſap, and ſweetnes from Chriſt; they were never <hi>truly members</hi> of Chriſt they did but hang on,<note place="margin">2. They were not true members of Chriſt.</note> they found ſome ſweetnes in the <hi>back</hi> of Religion in the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of Religion: but if they had taſted of God rightly they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have gone away from him. So I ſay this ſhould encourage thee to come in.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the maine work is done to thy hand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That that, that is left, are but a few, and eaſie things in compariſon of the ſervice of Satan; and of Papiſts; and of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law; and of naturall men that ſerve God for life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to make it more eaſie yet,<note place="margin">3. Chriſt will give his Spirit to doe that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</note> thoſe few things that are to doe, the Lord Jeſus will give his Spirit to doe them; he will <hi>doe all thy works for thee;</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects not that thou ſhouldeſt doe them in thy owne ſtrength: but he hath promiſed to give his Spirit, and that ſhall pray according to the will of God, So here thou ſhalt have a yoke, an eaſie one; and in that yoke thou ſhalt have Chriſt himſelfe to draw with thee, <hi>I can doe all, through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> There are but a few things that wee are bound to doe, and thoſe few things Chriſt will doe for us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, Conſider thoſe few things that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:132715:36"/>thou haſt the Spirit of Chriſt to doe for thee, how weake ſoever thou art in thy performance; the Lord Jeſus continually <hi>accepts</hi> of them: that is, the weakeſt prayer, and the weakeſt ſervice, of a ſincere Saint in the new Teſtament, it is a ſacrifice well pleaſing to God.</p>
                  <p>Who would continue in drunkeneſs; and lie in ſin, &amp; refuſe to come to Chriſt, when the wayes of Chriſt are ſo comfortable?</p>
                  <p>You will ſay; What doe you meane by <hi>comming</hi> to Chriſt? You would have us <hi>come</hi> to Chriſt, and you ſay, here is a comfortable way, and an eaſie yoke; what is it to <hi>come</hi> to Chriſt?<note place="margin">Coming to Chriſt what.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will tell you that, leaſt we looſe all our labour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. <hi>Ieſus ſaid, I am the bread of life; he that commeth to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth in me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> So that comming to Chriſt, is <hi>believing</hi> in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, I am to ſeek againe; I know not what that is, to believe in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſtand upon the definition, but a word, that thou maieſt underſtand what I meane by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>There are three things in it.<note place="margin">Believing in Chriſt what.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is to give <hi>credit</hi> to all that Chriſt tells thee. That is one thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to <hi>receive</hi> that life, and ſalvation; all that Chriſt Jeſus gives thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to the lawes that Jeſus Chriſt layes upon thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">To give credit to what hee teacheth,</note>I ſay, if thou wouldeſt know what it is to come to Chriſt, or to believe in Chriſt, it is, when thou wilt be taught by Jeſus Chriſt, when thou wilt give <hi>credit</hi> to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:132715:36"/>the things that he teacheth; As you ſee <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 2.2. <hi>Come</hi> (ſay the people) <hi>let us goe up to the mountaine of the Lord, and to the houſe of God; Let us goe up.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>He will teach us his waies, and we will walk in his pathes: for out of Sion ſhall goe the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi> This is to come to Chriſt, when our eares are open, and our hearts are ready to heare and learne whatſoever Jeſus Chriſt ſhall teach us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we ſay to a drunkard, or to a carnall man or woman that are in their ſinnes (as I was) <hi>come</hi> to Chriſt; what doe we meane by that? Be not refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>be not wiſe in thine owne eyes</hi> any more, doe not come, and heare the Preacher, and yet believe as thou liſt: but lay thy ſoule at the feet of Chriſt, and be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive the inſtruction that Chriſt teacheth thee. Doe not as children doe with their bread, take it and crumble it on the ground to the dogges, and eat one bit themſelves, and throw away another; So doe not crumble the word of God, to take one bit, and throw another bit to thy neighbour, and another at thy heeles when thou goeſt out of doores; no, but receive all that Chriſt teacheth thee, though it be contrarie to thy corruption, and above thy reaſon, yet indeavour to believe it. That is one thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to believe in Chriſt, or to <hi>come</hi> to Chriſt,<note place="margin">2. To accept life and ſalvation from him.</note> is when thou art willing to accept of, and to receive life, &amp; ſalvation that Chriſt offereth. Whereas it may be thou now art a naturall man, this is thy condition; either thou art a ſottiſh creature, and doeſt not think of life and ſalvation any where, thou careſt not for life, or death, but goeſt on like a beaſt; or if thou doeſt, thou haſt a little devotion of thine owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing; or thou lieſt deſperately in ſin, either of theſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:132715:37"/>is thy condition. Therefore now this is to come to Chriſt; looke not what thou art <hi>worthy</hi> to have: but what God is <hi>willing</hi> to give; God is willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow everlaſting life freely, therefore looke upon the brazen Serpent that is lift up, and indeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and accept of that ſalvation that is offered by him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. To ſubmit to Chriſts lawes.</note> be willing to ſubmit to the lawes of Chriſt: for Chriſt calls to thee as a King. Therefore in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. (I believe that is the meaning of the place, though there be more in it) <hi>Come unto me yee that are wearie and heavie laden, and I will give you reſt; for my yoke is eaſie, and my burthen is light.</hi> What is it to <hi>come</hi> to Chriſt? When I am <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>come</hi> out of other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and to leave other maſters. I will ſerve the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and my luſts no more: but I will come under the Standard of Chriſt; Chriſt hath lift up a Standard &amp; expects that every one ſhould ſubmit to his bleſſed Law. Therefore put theſe things together, labour to underſtand them, and remember them, and the Lord bleſſe them to thee, that after this day thou maieſt not lie ſotting in ſin: but that every one may come to Chriſt, that he may teach you &amp; inrich you with life, that hee may rule over you, and that you may be his ſubjects for ever. There are other Uſes of this point that I muſt leave till the afternoone.</p>

                  <q>That Saints in the new Teſtament in point of lawfulnes, are not ſo ſtrictly bound, as the Saints were under the old Teſtament.</q>
                  <p>This you had proved, and opened to you in ſome meaſure the laſt day.</p>
                  <p>In the morning we had occaſion from this doctrine by the by, to call upon poore ſinners to come in to Chriſt: becauſe their is ſuch largenes, and liberty and ſpaciouſnes in the wayes of Chriſt; The yoke of Chriſt is ſo eaſie.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſhall goe forward to a Uſe or two more that remaine of this doctrine, that wee may proceed to the next.</p>

                     <hi>reprove</hi> them from this doctrine, we may diſcover them at leaſt. I will not uſe any nick-names, it may be you would underſtand more clearely what I mean if I ſhould: But I ſee the devill gets much advantage by nick-names, by calling men <hi>Prebyterians,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and I know not what; therefore I beſeech you beware, how you uſe thoſe names, (though I ſay not it is unlawfull) yet there be miſtakes, (let us call them as gently as we can) that are generally among us, either</p>
                  <p>On the left hand, or On the right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Thoſe that erre on the left hand.</note>And both are to be reproved from this doctrine.</p>
                  <p>On the left hand, I mean thoſe that make every thing lawfull, and would have no <hi>band,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Thoſe that would make the way wider than Chriſt hath.</note> nor <hi>tie</hi> (as it were) they would make the way <hi>wider</hi> than Chriſt hath made it; they would makea greater <hi>latitude</hi> than God hath made. Now I ſay, theſe all come to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, from this word <hi>ALL</hi> in the text: for I ſhewed that by the word <hi>all</hi> is not meant <hi>all</hi> things in a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſallity, that I may be any thing, I may be a <hi>drunkard,</hi> and be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I may be a <hi>ſwearer,</hi> and be a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> I may doe what I liſt, and yet be a <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> but (as I ſaid) by <hi>all things</hi> is meant many things, &amp; thoſe that take it univerſally will doe nothing. Therefore on the left hand I ſay, theſe doe miſtake; and of theſe there be three ſorts, all godly Chriſtians I hope they are, (I wiſh every one to own his ſhare, and my ſelfe where I am guilty.)</p>
                  <p>There are one ſort of people among us, (you have a name for them, but I will not uſe it) that doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſo much beautie, and lovelines in <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things, in grace, and the worke of the Spirit, in the perſon, and excellencies of Chriſt, and the like that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:132715:38"/>they looke upon the externall manner of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or government as a ſmal contemptible thing, with a diſdainfull eye. Beloved, I make not men of ſtraw to ſpeak to: but I know many godly people that hold ſo, that ſay it is ridiculous, and they care not which way the Church of God be ordered, or governed, becauſe the Kingdome of God conſiſts in <hi>righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt;</hi> And they ſmile to ſee contentions between <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and others, and think that theſe are too mean, and too low things for Saints to looke after. Give me leave to tell you my thoughts, I confeſſe as I conceive that of all others, this is the leaſt error, yet it is an error, and miſtake: for though it be true that ſpirituall things are the maine, and other things are but little to be regarded in comparriſon, under the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet I may ſay of outward things as farre as Chriſt hath enjoyn'd them, as Chriſt ſaith of tything <hi>mint,</hi> and <hi>anniſe,</hi> when he ſpeaks of <hi>righteouſneſs, Theſe things ought yee to have one: but the other you ought not to have left undone.</hi> So this is the maine worke for a Chriſtian to doe, and it is bleſſed to ſee a Saint make that his maine ſtudie. But if God make lawes, and give commands, about externall things, outward things, I muſt not neglect that neither. It is (as one obſerves) as with the Saints and the world, they both ſee the miſery: but the Saints begin to ſtudie the cauſes of contention; and the old ſaying is, happy is he that knows the cauſes.<note place="margin">One cauſe of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> One maine cauſe of contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among us is, God comes now with more light than wee had before; we have more, and more; but this light is not a full light, I mean thus, this light comes, and ſhines but in part of the will of God to us: that is,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132715:39"/>we ſee part of the will of God, and part wee ſee not, and while we learne one part, we forget another part of the will of God. And this is ordinary among Chriſtians, while they learne <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>juſtification,</hi> they forget <hi>puritie,</hi> and <hi>holines;</hi> while they learne <hi>Church-diſcipline,</hi> they forget godlineſs; while they learne holineſs within, they forget obedience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of heavenly things comes into the ſoules of people now a dayes, as the Sun ſhines on the earth; How is that? You know when the Sun ſhines in our horizon, it doth not ſhine to the other end of the world, it is night with them when it is day with us; So, when the light ſhewes one thing, another truth is loſt; And this is the reaſon of diviſion, light is come, but it is not a full light, it reveales not all the will of God, but teacheth one, one thing, and another, another. We ſee not all together. This is one thing wherein men miſtake; though I much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them for their prizing of ſpirituall things, yet if their be a real command of God in outward things I humbly beſeech you that you would not diſdaine, and deſpiſe it. That is all I have to ſay to them.</p>
                  <p>There are a ſecond ſort of people that miſtake on the left hand,<note place="margin">2 Thoſe that aboliſh the morrall Law.</note> and make the rule wyder than it is; thoſe that goe farther than thoſe; that is, that doe not only ſlight, external worſhip, &amp; government &amp;c. As farre as God hath laid it downe but breake downe the pales, even to the <hi>morall law</hi> of God, and think that the way is now ſo wide that even the ten commandements, that the <hi>morall law</hi> it ſelf is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; there are ſome conceive ſo. But concerning that I think there is no ſubject that I could prove more
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:132715:39"/>fully, with ſtronger arguments, yet I will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you nor my ſelf now; and I ſhewed before how Chriſt came not to deſtroy the <hi>morall law;</hi> neither for that uſe that <hi>Paul</hi> makes of it, to <hi>reveale ſin,</hi> to make us <hi>eſteeme of Chriſt,</hi> or to be a light, the Spirit being within: for they are not contradictorie as ſome ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply think and ſpeak; but the <hi>Spirit</hi> within, and the <hi>law</hi> without is a lanthorne. Only the damnation is gone: but there are other motives to obey it; <hi>heaven and earth ſhall paſſe, but the law of God ſhall not paſſe.</hi> So now you ſee two ſorts. And I hope, if there be any ſuch here that they will alſo take their ſhares: for if every one would here with humilitie and take his part I hope there would ſoone be an end of moſt of our contentions.</p>
                  <p>The third ſort goe farther than thoſe on the left hand,<note place="margin">3 Thoſe that allow out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs, &amp; only ſerve God in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note> they make it ſo broad this <hi>all things are lawfull.</hi> That not only in point of goverment, or of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law (for thoſe that hold againſt the morrall law they hold that we ought to doe the things, but not upon the ſame motives; they hold that we are not to be whoremongers, and drunkards, &amp;c.) but the third ſort ſay, if we worſhip God in our <hi>ſpirits</hi> it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what we doe with our <hi>bodies,</hi> we may worſhip God in our <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and goe to <hi>maſſe,</hi> and doe any thing, the bodie is but as a toole in a carpenters hand.</p>
                  <p>It is not worth the while to confute thoſe, I could give many reaſons to the contrary. Chriſt hath <hi>redeemed ſoul,</hi> and <hi>bodie,</hi> therfore we muſt <hi>gloryfie God</hi> in both. And you know the <hi>ſoule</hi> and <hi>bodie</hi> that goe on in ſin ſhall be damned the one and the other: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>bodie</hi> hath need to looke to it as well as the ſoul. And we are commanded to beare witnes to the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:132715:40"/>truth of God, how can we doe it if the <hi>bodie</hi> may doe any thing? we need never ſuffer perſecution, as all that are in Chriſt muſt; if I will be content to ſerve Chriſt in my ſoule only, I will not ſuffer perſecution, I will goe to <hi>maſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſweare,</hi> and be <hi>drunk</hi> &amp;c. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, we are called to be <hi>like Chriſt</hi> and he was holie in <hi>ſoule,</hi> and <hi>bodie;</hi> how can we be <hi>like</hi> him if we will be holie in our ſouls only and not in our bodies? Nay it is impoſſible: for <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh:</hi> that is, if the ſoule be holie, the bodie will be ſo too: if there be <hi>wickednes</hi> in the <hi>heart</hi> there muſt be wickednes in the <hi>bodie,</hi> and if there be <hi>holines</hi> in the <hi>ſoul,</hi> there will be alſo in the <hi>bodie.</hi> If any hold an opinion to make contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by it, let them take it as an admonition from the Lord to conſider what they do. Thus you ſe the errors on the lefthand. As I deſire power of the Lord to tell you what think, ſo I deſire that you would indeavour to underſtand.</p>
                  <p>The errours on the right hand are contrarie to this,<note place="margin">2 Errors on the right hand.</note> when as Paule ſaith <hi>All things are lawfull</hi> as the one makes it univerſall that <hi>every</hi> thing is lawfull, ſo the other makes <hi>nothing</hi> lawfull almoſt. My meaning is this; they on the right hand having an <hi>old Taſtament ſpirit</hi> (mark that word, for from thence is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention) having a ſpirit not ſuitable to the new Teſtament; though (miſtake me not) they differ but in degrees cheifly, and principally) they make <hi>lawes</hi> and <hi>ties,</hi> and <hi>bonds,</hi> and <hi>knotts,</hi> and <hi>knacks</hi> and many ridiculous things to tie, and bind themſelves, where Chriſt Jeſus in the new teſtament hath not bound them; and hence comes chiefly the contentions, and controverſies of theſe times betweene two ſorts of people; you know who they are. Though I conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:132715:40"/>conceive that in the things themſelves, the one may be in when the other are out, and the other may be in when they are out; the one partie may be in in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, &amp; the other may be in when they are wrong in ſomethings: yet though they be never ſo violent, though they be ready to <hi>devoure one another,</hi> and ready to ſet the Kingdom, &amp; nation on fire, and ſay, we will have our way, and you ſhall not have yours: yet (marke it) they both agree in this; all theſe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they come from the ſame principle. (I ſpeake not of every particular man, but of the generality of both wayes) it comes from an <hi>old Teſtament ſpirit</hi> in the one, and in the other. And though they be contrary as light and darknes, point blank enemies, yet as I have ſometimes ſeen two rivers, run con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wayes that have ſprung from the ſame head, and hill: ſo the one and the other; (if I miſtake not) of the great controverſies at this time, it comes from an <hi>old Teſtament ſpirit</hi> in the one as well as in the other.</p>
                  <p>What is <hi>an old Teſtament ſpirit?</hi>

                  <p>I ſpeake not to make the breach wider;<note place="margin">Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpirit what.</note> but deſire that it may be healed: therfore I ſay that you may take notice of it, &amp; take heed of it, <hi>an old Teſtament ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is this, that there is in both a diſpoſition to make a curious externall peice of <hi>government;</hi> as curious, nay ſay they, why not more curious than <hi>Moſes</hi> made in the <hi>Old?</hi> I ſay, in externall things. And out of this principle every one will have his brat, and ſtraine and ſqueeze the Scripture one this way, and another that, and make fine peices that will never ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Only with this difference, that the one ſide, (that in this are the honeſter of the two) they endleſſely make
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:132715:41"/>lawes, and ties for their own conſciences, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party they make lawes, and ties, upon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of others.</p>
                  <p>The one party is alway ſcrupulous;<note place="margin">1.

I could give divers inſtances, as in that of dipping over head and eares: becauſe the word <hi>bapto</hi> ſignifies over head and eares ſometimes, and becauſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <hi>em</hi> ſignifies to go into, from that they binde all the Saints all the world over to goe into rivers; ſo that if a man be not <hi>dipped</hi> but only <hi>ſprinkled,</hi> becauſe of the prepoſition <hi>em,</hi> that makes a nullitie of the Church, that it is no Church, and ſo conſequently there ſhall be no Church at all: ſo from prepoſitions and particles, they make rules that Chriſt hath not tied them to.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not to diſparage the leaſt tittle of the Scripture: for <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſſe, before one jot or tittle of it ſhall paſſe:</hi> But take this too, it is not every <hi>tittle</hi> or <hi>affix,</hi> nor every <hi>prepoſition,</hi> nor every

                  <p>The other ſort of people have the ſame principle alſo,<note place="margin">2. Such as make laws to binde others.</note> they would have a <hi>curious externall</hi> peice in the new Teſtament: but with this difference, that they would not be ſo ſcrupulous to themſelves (for many of them walk large &amp; broad enough) but their fingers itch to make lawes, and ties to <hi>binde</hi> the <hi>conſciences</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> and ſo they look upon the old Teſtament, and ſee that a compleat peice; how the Paſſeover was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, how they muſt take the lamb, and at what age, and how long they muſt keep it, and when they muſt kill it, and what poſture they muſt uſe, and what ſauce they muſt have; they ſee it a curious peice, and they look on the new Teſtament (though they ſpeak not ſo) as if Chriſt had left it very darke, and ſhort, and briefe. And indeed to ſpeak the truth, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of Chriſt had been to make a curious externall peice under the new Teſtament as under the old, they did think right, no man could diſprove them: but Chriſt of purpoſe left things briefe, as I ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; How moderately, and ſpairingly, and covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord mentions Ordinances in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: now they concluding that the worſhip of God in the new Teſtament muſt be more glorious than in the old, and in outward things; there upon they make Canons, and eech it out; and in ſo doing, they make ſuch ties upon indifferent things, and things that Chriſt hath not determined to the Saints, that though
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:132715:42"/>the things be otherwiſe good in themſelves, yet they have this evill, one of the greateſt in any Church in the world; they bring the glorious ſonnes of <hi>Sion</hi> under the New-Teſtament back againe to the Old.</p>
                  <p>So it hath been alway from the beginning:<note place="margin">Popes practiſe.</note> for wee ſee the Popes heretofore, they alway looked on the new Teſtament as a lame thing, ſhort, and dark; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they made <hi>Canon</hi> upon <hi>Canon,</hi> and <hi>Article</hi> upon <hi>Article,</hi> every Pope made Canons, and lawes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretalls till they were endleſſe, to determine things that are undetermined, that are left to the wiſdom of the Saints in their riper age, (all a long an old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpirit,) that they might make a curious out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peice.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the Biſhops,<note place="margin">Bishops practiſe.</note> they looked on the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament as dark, and lame, and they would take it and digeſt it into a method; and make other bookes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a new Teſtament, that a man might be a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> and never ſee the <hi>Bible,</hi> and a man might be a good Catholik and never ſee the <hi>Bible;</hi> So they made the thirtie-nine Articles, and decrees, and Canons to eech out the new Teſtament, and the miniſter muſt ſay this with a loud voyce, and that with a low voyce; and now he muſt ſit, and now he muſt ſtand; and hee muſt read one leſſon here, and another there; and here he muſt read the firſt, and there the ſecond <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;</hi> and if he were rich he muſt weare long clothes, and if he were poore he muſt weare ſhort. What an abominable thing is it to tie the ſonnes of God that are not babies, now under tutors, with paltrie things, when the Spirit of God in the leaſt Saint is better able to determine than all the Biſhops.</p>

                  <p>Therefore this makes my heart to bleed;<note place="margin">Presbytery &amp; Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency.</note> I am not aſhamed nor afraid to tell you my ſerious thoughts concerning theſe two wayes, (if you will, call them <hi>PRESBYTERY</hi> and <hi>INDEPENDENCY</hi>) For that of <hi>Independency,</hi> as I never ſaw, nor was apprehenſive what harme it could do to overthrow the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or to deſtroy the Kingdome, as men ſay; Wee muſt have but one Religion, and <hi>hang</hi> them, and <hi>draw</hi> them, and <hi>baniſh</hi> them: as I am not ſenſible of theſe feares; ſo on the other ſide, if you call that <hi>Presbytery,</hi> that godly men call ſo; when a godly Church appeales to godly Miniſters, to determine that which they cannot determine themſelves; I cannot ſee but in ſome caſes, and ſome times, and ſome Churches, ſuch a thing may be <hi>convenient</hi> and <hi>expedient;</hi> and if that were all in <hi>Presbytery,</hi> I would never ſpeak againſt it, I ſay, take <hi>Presbytery</hi> as godly men expreſſe it, (not as ignorant men take it, for they mean tyranny) I ſee no ſuch great danger in that, that <hi>Presbytery</hi> will be a thing to deſtroy us, but there may be ſome things in it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: but I profeſſe before God and the world, my greateſt feare, and griefe, and trouble is that from <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and <hi>Independency,</hi> between the one, and the other, they are both in a way to make the Saints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the new Teſtament, the glorious ſonnes of <hi>Sion</hi> all <hi>babies,</hi> and to tie little knots, &amp; querks upon their own ſouls, and the ſouls of others, to bring them to the <hi>old Teſtament</hi> againe. Where Chriſt hath bound us let us be bound: but where he hath made us free let us doe all to the glory of God, and for <hi>expediencie</hi> and <hi>edification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore ſtrive not about ſtrawes, whether wee ſhall appeale to other people when we cannot doe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:132715:43"/>things of our ſelves,<note place="margin">A ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing to tie the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> where Chriſt hath not tied them.</note> but go to the root, the principle of both in the generality tends as ſtrongly the one as the other, to make babies of the Saints. What a ſhamefull, ſtrange, ridiculous thing would it be, if a <hi>Doctor,</hi> or <hi>Batchelor</hi> of Divinity ſhould come from <hi>Oxford</hi> with gray-haires and a learned man, and you ſhould make him a little coate, and put him on a ſachell, and give him a Horne-book, or A B C, and put a feſtraw in his hand and turne him to ſchoole; What a great diſparagement would it be? would it not be ridiculous, and intolerably fooliſh? So God will be ſerved in the new Teſtament, in <hi>Spirit:</hi> and Chriſt now hath made the Saints free in abundance of things, and for us to make little <hi>knick-knacks,</hi> little lawes to tie the Saints hand and foot, and to binde them faſter than ever they were under <hi>Moſes;</hi> To tell the Saints in the new Teſtament, here you muſt put out your hand, and here, that they cannot ſanctifie a Sabbath, or make a Sermon, but they muſt be told when they muſt ſit, and when they muſt ſtand, and what they muſt doe, this is the miſery, this, this, this makes the hearts of Chriſtians to bleed. There is ſomething in <hi>Presbytery</hi> that might be <hi>expedient,</hi> and ſomewhat in <hi>Independency,</hi> and it would eaſily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; but this is the plague, we would bring the ſons of <hi>Sion</hi> in the new Teſtament to be babies. I foreſee this, and point it out for you, to take notice of that <hi>old Teſtament ſpirit,</hi> that wee may not make lawes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves, where God hath not made lawes on us: therefore pray to the Lord to end that, and then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the other will hurt you. That is the ſecond Uſe.</p>
                  <p>Only there might be an objection, whether it be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:132715:43"/>not lawfull for the Magiſtrates, or the Churches, or the Miniſters to make lawes to tie their ſubjects, or members, in things that Chriſt hath not abſolutely determined? But concerning that I mean to handle the objection more fully when I ſhall ſpeake concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>expediency;</hi> therefore I ſhall leave it till then.

                     <note place="margin">Guilt in the the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> whence.</note>Marke it, moſt of the guilt and feares of the Saints is, ordinarily not from the doing of ill, but from the miſdoing of good: that is, they apprehend themſelves bound to ſuch a dutie, and God calls them to another dutie, and there is guilt ariſeth from that, they doe one thing, when their conſciences tell them they are bound to doe another; As for inſtance, it is your dutie to <hi>pray morning</hi> and <hi>evening</hi> in your families,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:132715:44"/>it is ſo, and more, ſeven times a day if you can: but you make all things lawfull, you will doe nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>expediency,</hi> you make it ſo of neceſſitie, that if you miſſe in the one, or the other you ſin. As for inſtance, you have taken apart your family to pray, and you are called at that time to relieve a poore man, and though you have done a better deed, yet becauſe you binde your ſelves where God hath not bound you, there is guilt on your conſciences. So, you make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other law to read Chapters twice a day, you have bound your ſelves, and you ſin if you doe it not; but a greater dutie comes that is worth the reading often Chapters, yet becauſe you neglect that you ſin, and carry guilt on you: So three parts of foure of your guilt, it ariſeth from ignorance, you know not which God will have: I pray when I ſhould read, or I preach when I ſhould pray, or when I ſhould do good to my brother, it comes from ignorance. God hath not tied us to the number of Chapters, or theſe things: but as it may be for <hi>expediency,</hi> for the glory of God, and the <hi>edification</hi> of our brethren; which if you did know, when a greater dutie comes you would take it in hand; So you make a law, you muſt begin read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Prayer, it is ſinne to read without praying. It is convenient to pray at all times: but if you make it an abſolute law, there will be guilt upon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience when you omit it, though the occaſion be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great.

                  <p>Shall I goe a little further?<note place="margin">Ignorance of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty hindere from win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others.</note> For the want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and underſtanding your Chriſtian Liberty, there is this miſery, that you are not able to win the ſouls of others.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:132715:45"/>
                  <p>Why ſo?</p>
                  <p>Becauſe you have tied your ſelves hand and foot that you cannot ſtoop to win ſouls. Saith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>To the Jew I became as a Jew, and to them without law, as without law: I was weake to the weake, I was all things to all, that I might win ſome.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Chriſt hath given me a great deale of liberty to this end, that I might accommodate, and apply my ſelf; (beware of miſtaking me) not to accommodate my ſelfe to my own ends, to pleaſe my luſts: but he hath given me a latitude to ſtoop to mens diſpoſitions, and wayes to win their ſouls. Now, if <hi>Pauls</hi> religion had been as many now, that is, to be tied hand and foot, that either all was <hi>lawfull</hi> or <hi>unlawfull,</hi> he would not have bended an ace to win the world; therefore let us learne to know our liberty.</p>
                  <p>I could give many ſad inſtances, how hence men tied knots, that it is not <hi>lawfull</hi> to come into ſuch a houſe as this; it may be it may not be <hi>expedient,</hi> but they make it abſolutely <hi>unlawfull.</hi> One man makes it unlawfull to come into a Pulpit; it may be it is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient: but they will not have it lawfull; and ſo hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of ſouls are ſtarved, they make ties where God hath made none; and ſo we cannot do good to others for want of knowing our liberty.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, let us ſtudie to know our liberty; for the want of knowing our Chriſtian liberty,<note place="margin">Ignorance of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty the cauſe of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> is the maine cauſe of contention, of the contentions of theſe times I mean.</p>
                  <p>How is that?</p>
                  <p>I will tell you how, On the one ſide, the one partie will doe nothing through the yeare, but look at all as abſolutely lawfull, or unlawfull. Wee are come to a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:132715:45"/>fine paſſe, that you muſt pray before you read, or elſe you ſin &amp;c. And men are ſo hide-bound, and tied, that they will not condeſcend to their brethren an ace. We are bound to condeſcend to others, and to be of <hi>one minde,</hi> that we may doe good to ſuch, as wee were formerly: but ſaith one, I will not forgoe the truth for a world; and one man calls this truth, and another that. Men are bound head and heeles, and will not condeſcend one jot to others, this is for want of the knowledge of our liberty. Chriſt hath given us ſuch a latitude, take heed of abuſing it, of going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, yet take heed to ſtudie it.</p>
                  <p>One the other ſide, it makes their fingers itch to ſet out lawes for others, to tell the Saints when they ſhall put out their hand, and when they ſhall pul it in; as the Preiſts in the Law, when they ſhall ſpeak with a loud voyce, and when with a low, when they ſhall be down, and when up. If men knew their liberty it would ſave a world of labour. That is one dutie, labour to know and underſtand your liberty, you will be ſlaves and undoe your ſelves elſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond dutie is, doe not <hi>enfring</hi> your liberty, <note place="margin">2. Not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring our liberty.</note> doe not leſſen it. As how? I would not have you make lawes and ties upon your ſelves for every little thing, where God hath not made it.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, it is true, where God hath not made them, we would make none: but God hath given us examples; Is not that a law to us? and he hath given us precepts; Are not thoſe lawes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample makes not a law.</note>It is not every example, nor every precept that makes a law to the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Not every example; if you look on the example of the Apoſtles, they did many things that you are
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:132715:46"/>not to follow, they killed a man and his wife, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. they caſt out devills, they ſmote men with blindneſſe, they anointed with oyle; yet preſently they would not tie the Churches all the world over.</p>
                  <p>Look upon the Churches, they did ſell their lands in the beginning of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and they brought the money to the Apoſtles, and laid it at their feet; this example was not a rule, for the Churches after did not ſo: but made collections and contributions; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed of making examples rules. Nay, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt Jeſus himſelf in many things is not a rule, for he walked on the Sea, and whipped the buyers and ſellers out of the <hi>Temple.</hi> What Chriſt <hi>did,</hi> and did not <hi>command,</hi> we are not to follow; And why not the like of the Apoſtles? what the Apoſtles <hi>did,</hi> and <hi>commanded</hi> wee are to follow: but what they did and is not commanded it may be, is not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Saints had <hi>feaſts of love,</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Jude Theſe are blots in your feaſts.</hi> Continually when they came to the Supper every one brought his meat, as we ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Where are thoſe examples now? Be warie of examples. Indeed examples with precepts make a rule, and it is very commendable to follow them: but where it is without a precept take heed of making it a law.</p>
                  <p>And then for precepts,<note place="margin">many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that binde not all the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:132715:46"/>(I ſpeak with reverence) that is, commands where the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in the perſon of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane man, as in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, Be not righteous over much.</hi> The holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in the language of prophane men, and rather ſhewes the nature of prophane men, than what men ſhould doe; and there are abundance of ſuch in <hi>Job:</hi> Take heed that we make not lawes of theſe for all Saints, and all ages, to binde their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
                  <p>And then their are temporall precepts, that were meerly ceremoniall in the old Teſtament; and in the new Teſtament, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. the Apoſtles forbid <hi>things ſtrangled</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> this was a temporall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as I could ſhew at large: but this temporall did not binde all, in all things, becauſe after there was a precept to contradict it, as we ſee the holy Ghoſt bids to eat <hi>whatſoever is ſet before us;</hi> and <hi>Every creature of God is good, if it be ſanctified with the word and prayer.</hi> There is nothing to be refuſed, it is an univerſall word, So, what will you make of that, <hi>ſalute one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an holy kiſſe?</hi> VVhy follow you not that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept?</p>
                  <p>There are precepts of Indulgence that binde not, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Of every tree in the garden thou ſhalt eat: but of the tree in the middeſt of the garden eat not.</hi> Now here was a command for Adam to eat of every other tree, as well as not to eat of that: but the former is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of indulgence, and this precept did not binde ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely; ſo that if he had not eaten of every tree, hee had not ſinned. And ſo in the matter of divorce, the man was to give his wife a <hi>bill</hi> of <hi>divorce;</hi> this did not binde, if a man did take his wife in adulterie, and would live with her, he did not ſin: but if he did turne her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:132715:47"/>he muſt give her a bill of divorce. There are many others; you ſee every example, and every precept bindes not,<note place="margin">To learne how much precept or example make an abſolute rule.</note> therefore be wonderous warie how you make lawes, and rules to binde you. Ask godly men this queſtion (for I am not able to anſwer it) what precept or example, or how much precept, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, doth make an abſolute rule for all Churches in all ages? anſwer that queſtion, and moſt of our contentions are gone. It is not enough to ſay Sir, I goe according to the Scripure, the word ſaith this; and this propoſition ſaith ſo: but ask godly men how much precept and example goes to make an abſolute neceſſarie rule for all ages, anſwer that, and then thou walkeſt ſafely. But the want of knowing our Chriſtian liberty undoes thee.</p>
                  <p>You take the Book of God, as if it were all aphoriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and Theorems, and Canons; No, the Book of God (to ſpeak with reverence) is like the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and there we know ſometime what is right by the Judges opinion, ſometime by paralell caſes, ſometimes by expediency. Now you ſay, let ſuch a man bring me Scripture; what Scrirpture? any line whatſoever, and they (ſimple people) bring a place or two, and make an abſolute rule to binde you, and all the world.</p>
                  <p>Remember, the greateſt miſerie to an honeſt heart (next to an old Teſtament ſpirit, that is the riſe of all) is this, a miſdrawing of rules out of the word of God: you take a word and doe not compare it with other Scriptures, and ſee whether it be temporarie and doth abſolutely binde: but you goe with your book under your arme, and think all wiſe men are out, &amp; you have Scripture for it: beware of that. Therefore (as I ſaid)
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:132715:47"/>learne what precept or example, or how much goes to make an abſolute rule, to all the Saints in all ages, that they muſt not break; when you underſtand that you may draw rules.</p>
                  <p>So, let me ſpeak to the other party,<note place="margin">Not to binde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with lawes where Chriſt hath not bound them.</note> make not lawes upon the Saints, where Chriſt hath not made any: for the Saints are noble ſpirited men, and a noble ſpirited man had rather doe a hundred things, then be bound to one; I would doe a hundred things that Chriſt hath not commanded, and leave undone a hundred things that Chriſt hath not forbidden, rather than be tied to one thing by men that Chriſt hath not commanded; I had rather doe a hundred things for edification that Chriſt hath not determined. If you binde the Saints, it will make them leave that undone that they ſhould have done.</p>
                  <p>The third dutie is, abuſe not your libertie,<note place="margin">3. Not to abuſe Chriſtian liberty.</note> 
                     <hi>you are called to liberty</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, I muſt make it known: but abuſe it not <hi>for an occaſion to the fleſh, or as a cloak for maliciouſneſſe.</hi> Abuſe not your liberty, for your own ends to avoid perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to get wealth &amp;c. Abuſe it not by making it larger and broader than God hath made it; it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to add commandments to the law of God, that he hath not made, and ſo it is as dangerous to deſtroy that, that God hath made: therefore ſaith <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Lord, it is time for thee to put to thy hand:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dangerous to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any of Gods lawes.</note> 
                     <hi>for men have deſtroyed thy law.</hi> It is ſafer, and better for a man to break the Law of God five hundred times, than to take away one law that God hath made, to make the way larger, and wider than God hath made it; As, becauſe I ſaid God hath not abſolutely bound you to pray twice a day; ſome man may goe home
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:132715:48"/>and therefore he will not pray at all, thou art a wretched man, when lawfulneſſe is gone, thou wilt doe nothing for edification, and expediency. Take heed, that you may doe that that is for the building up of your own ſoules, and for the edification of your brethren.</p>
                  <p>To conclude,<note place="margin">4. To hold faſt Chriſtian liberty.</note> the fourth, and laſt thing is, hold faſt your liberty; let not men take away your liberty; <hi>be not ſervants to men. If I be the ſervant of men</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt;</hi> and yet he ſaith, <hi>I am your ſervant,</hi> that is, doe not tie me, and I will ſerve you and doe any thing: but if you binde a Saint, and make lawes where Chriſt hath not bound him, you ſhall never bring him to it, a Chriſtian had rather doe a hundred things that God hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: he can doe it, but he is loath to be bound ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to one; The way to get the Saints to do any thing, is not to binde, and tie them hand and foot, I mean in things that God hath not determined. There was a ſtir in the Church about <hi>Timothy,</hi> the Church then had but little knowledge, and they heard that <hi>Paul</hi> converſed with the heathens, <hi>Paul</hi> adviſed with the Church, and he circumciſed him, and ſhaved his head, he doth all this to get their love: but afterward when they would have circumciſed <hi>Titus</hi> by a law, hee would not yeild a jot; though I did it in love concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Timothy,</hi> yet I will not be bound by any man to circumciſe <hi>Titus:</hi> But held faſt his liberty. So much for that Doctrine.</p>

                  <p>All <hi>lawfull</hi> things I ſay, are not <hi>expedient:</hi> For the opening of it I ſhall ſhew theſe two thing;</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Whatmea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by lawfull things.</note> what is meant by <hi>lawfull</hi> things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what is here meant by <hi>expedient</hi> things.</p>
                  <p>I ſpake ſomewhat of it before: but that you may underſtand me concerning the firſt: there are three ſorts of things according to the Scripture that may be ſaid to be <hi>inexpedient,</hi> or <hi>inconvenient</hi> for a Saint to doe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is <hi>inconvenient, inexpedient</hi> for a Saint to doe things that are <hi>purely,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Things that are ſimply evil</note> and <hi>ſimply evil,</hi> though it be not properly ſaid to be <hi>inexpedient,</hi> as unlawfull, yet in a ſort it is <hi>inexpedient alwayes,</hi> to all <hi>people,</hi> in all <hi>places,</hi> they are never ſit to be done, they are both <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull</hi> and <hi>inexpedient,</hi> as it is in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all uncleanneſs, or covetouſneſſe, let it not once be named among you, as becometh Saints: neither filthines, nor fooliſh talking, nor jeſting, which are not convenient.</hi> which are not <hi>expedient,</hi> not <hi>ſeemly;</hi> Fornication, and whoredome, and filthineſs, ſuch things are never <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,</hi> or beſeeming a Chriſtian, to be a whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or a drunkard, or a cheater, (as I feare too many are) it is never <hi>expedient.</hi> So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. The Apoſtle
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:132715:49"/>ſaith that the people were <hi>Filled with all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they changed the naturall uſe to that which is againſt nature; and the men leaving the naturall uſe of the women, burned in their luſt one towards another, men with men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that which is UNSEEMLY.</hi> That is, they committed <hi>Sodomie</hi> man with man, and all ſorts of wickednes, and fornication, and covetouſneſs, and maliciouſneſs; <hi>being full of envie, murther, debate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, &amp;c.</hi> And what follows? <hi>The Lord gave them up to a reprobate minde, to do things that are not CONVENI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENT;</hi> which were not <hi>ſeemly.</hi> That I may trouble you no farther with that; <hi>evill</hi> things, that are <hi>ſimply</hi> evil are never <hi>convenient</hi> at any time, for any man to doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Things that are ſimply good in three caſes</note> a thing may be <hi>inexpedient</hi> ſometimes that is <hi>ſimply good, hic et nunc</hi> at ſometime, in ſome place, and to ſome perſons it may be <hi>inexpedient</hi> in theſe three Caſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when a <hi>greater</hi> good comes in,<note place="margin">1. When a greater good comes in.</note> a <hi>leſſer</hi> good ceaſeth, it is <hi>inexpedient.</hi> As for example, to read a chapter and expound to your families, it is <hi>expedient:</hi> but if my neighbours houſe be on fire, and his wife and children in it, it is <hi>inexpedient</hi> for me to expound, I am to leave that when a greater good comes in: as in <hi>Luke</hi> 13. to raiſe up a <hi>beaſt,</hi> or to waite upon ones <hi>parents</hi> being ſicke on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day; when a greater good comes in, the leſſer good is <hi>inexpedient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. When wee cannot come at the good without doing of evil.</note> a thing <hi>ſimply</hi> good may be <hi>inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> when I cannot come to the good unleſſe I will doe that that is <hi>evil;</hi> As if a man cannot preach in publicke except he will take the <hi>Caviliers oath,</hi> it is <hi>inexpedient,</hi> becauſe I cannot come at the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:132715:50"/>good but by doing the evil.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. When a greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will follow the good.</note> a thing <hi>ſimply good</hi> may be ſometime <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,</hi> when neceſſarily, and directly, and inevitably there will <hi>follow</hi> ſomething that is groſſely <hi>evil,</hi> that is a greater evil than the good, we doe, is good. I doe not ſay that evil by <hi>accident</hi> ſhould terrifie us from doing of good, for then wee ſhould never doe good. It may be you may ſtumble to heare me, and are the worſe. And a hundred things that fall by accident, theſe ſhould not terrifie me: but when evil appeares directly to follow, in ſome caſes it is not expedient to doe good. We are commanded to <hi>reprove the works of darkneſſe:</hi> but <hi>Mat. 6.</hi> if a man be a <hi>dogg</hi> or a <hi>ſwine,</hi> that is, in the height of darkneſſe, and wickedneſs, a man is not to reprove him, becauſe he will fall upon him, and <hi>rent</hi> him: for inſtance, I ſee a wicked man, and I have reproved him, and I am in danger of my life if I tell him of his evils; I am at my liberty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will reprove him, or no; So, God ſent <hi>Paul</hi> to preach to <hi>all Nations,</hi> yet he preached only to them of <hi>reputation, Gal.</hi> 2. That is, to <hi>wiſe underſtanding</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and kept it from other people: he was bid to preach to <hi>all Nations;</hi> but becauſe he ſaw he ſhould <hi>run invaine,</hi> and undoe his miniſtery if he ſhould doe it at that time, by reaſon of that he did not doe that that was ſimply good in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</note> things may be ſaid to be <hi>inexpedient,</hi> that are (as you call them) <hi>indifferent</hi> things, and by thoſe I mean, not only, nor chiefely, outward exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things, <hi>civill</hi> things, as <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> and <hi>ſitting,</hi> and <hi>walking,</hi> and the like: but I mean in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe <hi>every</hi> thing; thoſe things whatſoever they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:132715:50"/>be that God hath not abſolutely, and peremtorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in his will, and word in the new Teſtament, whether in Doctrine or Diſcipline in his Worſhip, (if I may ſo ſpeak, though improperly,) or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath not abſolutely <hi>determined;</hi> thoſe things I call <hi>indifferent.</hi> And though there be abundance of things that are not ſo <hi>determined</hi> that are <hi>lawfull</hi> for Chriſtians to doe, yet alway thoſe things are not <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> for them to doe.</p>
                  <p>And before I proceed farther to open this (which is the greateſt thing) I deſire you to take two cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.<note place="margin">Cautions.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, in opening to you this <hi>expediency</hi> that I am to ſpeak of, and the reſt, I ſhall make uſe of many Scriptures, that ſometimes mingle things ſimplie evil with things <hi>undetermined;</hi> now take it not, as though every thing that I ſhall name in a text I call things <hi>indifferent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, doe not conceive by what I have ſaid,<note place="margin">2. Nor to weaken things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</note> or by what I mean to ſay, that I goe about to innervate, or to weaken any thing that God hath determined in his word, God forbid: but my drift is to ſhew how you ſhould walk in reſpect of thoſe things (be they what they will) that God hath not <hi>determined:</hi> but left at liberty. So, obſerving that;</p>
                  <p>We come to the next thing, to ſhew what is <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All things are lawfull: but all things are not EXPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIENT.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, divers things are <hi>lawfull:</hi> for I ſpeak not properly of the two other, things <hi>ſimplie good,</hi> and <hi>ſimplie evil:</hi> but of things <hi>undetermined;</hi> and ſeeing every thing is not <hi>expedient;</hi> What is the meaning
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:132715:51"/>of that? what is the <hi>expediency</hi> of things?</p>
                  <p>By the word <hi>expedient</hi> in this text,<note place="margin">Expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy what.</note> I ſuppoſe the Lord takes one word that comprehends <hi>all</hi> thoſe <hi>rules</hi> that are to order and guide us in our <hi>converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in the uſe of things that are not abſolutely <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> or <hi>forbidden.</hi> It is a large word, <hi>ALL things are not expedient;</hi> that is, <hi>all</hi> things are not <hi>fit,</hi> not <hi>meet, all</hi> things are not <hi>worthy</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> they are not <hi>decent,</hi> they are not <hi>comely,</hi> they do not <hi>edifie,</hi> they are not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> not <hi>lovely,</hi> not <hi>vee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rable,</hi> not of good <hi>report.</hi> I beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eve it comprehends all, &amp; implies all, though it ſignifie ſome one thing more eſpecially in particular.</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe the words are many, and it would be tedious to ſhew all the rules, or expreſſions in Scripture, that teach us how to carrie our ſelves in theſe things, and finding the rules <hi>coinſidere,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the expreſſions to ſignifie the ſame thing: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will reduce all to foure heads, or generall rules, or expreſſions, that the holy Ghoſt uſeth concerning things <hi>undeterminea</hi> by the Lord in Scripture.<note place="margin">reduced to 4 heads</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>All things are not expedient.</hi>

                  <p>I confeſſe there is much <hi>ignorance</hi> in weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans not knowing their Chriſtian <hi>liberty,</hi> in meats, and drinks: but much is for want of diſcretion, and becauſe there is a great deale of unſanctifiedneſs in the heart, in the directing and managing of lawful things for the glory of God, and for their own peace, and quiet: for they follow their luſts, and abuſe lawful things that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man might doe without ſin.

                     <hi>Though divers things be lawfull to the Saints under the new Teſtament, yet but a few of thoſe things are expedient, and fit for a Saint to doe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the opening of it I propounded two things;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, what I mean by <hi>lawfull</hi> things: I inſtanced in three ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what is meant by <hi>EXPEDIENT?</hi> The word comprehends all the <hi>rules</hi> that are to <hi>order</hi> and guide us in the uſe of things that are not <hi>determined,</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:132715:56"/>that are not <hi>commanded</hi> nor <hi>forbidden.</hi> It is a large word, <hi>All things are not expedient.</hi> That is, all things are not <hi>fit,</hi> all things are not <hi>meet,</hi> not <hi>worthy</hi> the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, not <hi>decent,</hi> not <hi>comely;</hi> they doe not <hi>edifie,</hi> they are not <hi>convenient,</hi> they are not <hi>lovely,</hi> they are not <hi>venerable,</hi> they are not of <hi>good report.</hi> Now, becauſe the words are many, and it would be tedious to goe over all, I reduced all to foure heads, or expreſſions, that were as ſo many generall rules.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſhewed you what was meant by the word <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,</hi> in its own proper native ſignification.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now goe forward to the ſecond rule,<note place="margin">2. Con<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency or decency.</note> or the ſecond ſort of expreſſions; which indeed are many, yet they come all almoſt to the ſame. There is one word tranſlated it is <hi>decent;</hi> another it is <hi>comely;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is <hi>fit;</hi> another it <hi>beſeemeth;</hi> another it <hi>becometh;</hi> another it is <hi>worthy:</hi> all theſe, though in the Scripture in the originall ſeverall words are uſed, yet becauſe I will not trouble you, nor confound your memories with them. For methods ſake, and your plainer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, we may bring them together to ſignifie one, and the ſame thing, that is, <hi>conveniency</hi> or <hi>decency.</hi> So, <hi>All things are lawfull: but all things are not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi> That is, many <hi>lawfull</hi> things are not <hi>decent,</hi> they are not <hi>comely,</hi> not <hi>fit,</hi> not <hi>convenient,</hi> not <hi>beſeeming</hi> a Saint, a Chriſtian to doe. You ſhall have this word oft in the book of God, as in that place <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.4. (only remember the caution I gave you; I doe not ſay that all that are mentioned there are indifferent things: but it is for my purpoſe to open the word, <hi>fornication, and uncleanneſſe, and fooliſh talking, &amp; idle jeſting, which are not CONVENIENT;</hi> which doe not become Saints. So in 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 14. after that great diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:132715:57"/>Propheſie, and Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle ends all with this, <hi>Let every thing be done DECENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY, and in order.</hi> There is the ſame word, <hi>convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and in <hi>order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will ſay;<note place="margin">decency or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency what.</note> What is this <hi>decency,</hi> this <hi>conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beloved, if I ſhould goe no farther you underſtand this, that every <hi>lawful</hi> thing doth not <hi>become</hi> a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, you know what is the meaning of that; you ſay, ſuch a <hi>garment</hi> doth not <hi>become</hi> ſuch a man, and ſuch <hi>apparrel</hi> doth not <hi>become</hi> ſuch a woman; What is that? A <hi>decent</hi> thing negatively is a thing that doth not any way diſparage a man in any relation: for it may be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> in ſome <hi>reſpects,</hi> and yet wonderouſly diſparage him in another; as an old man, and a rich man, as he is a rich man, he is able to buy little gaudie things as well as children playing in the ſtreets: but as he is an old man to buy a <hi>capp</hi> and a <hi>feather</hi> he will not, becauſe it would be a diſparagement to him in that relation. So a decent thing is a thing that ſo <hi>beſeems</hi> a man that it doth not <hi>diſparage</hi> him in any relation.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, what <hi>relation</hi> is that wherein a Chriſtian needs to fear <hi>diſparagement</hi> by doing of <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> things? I will inſtance in ſome: for in theſe things it is impoſſible to deſcend much in particulairs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if you looke upon the <hi>perſon</hi> of a Saint,<note place="margin">In reſpect of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> What is he? He is the <hi>ſon</hi> of <hi>God</hi> an <hi>heire</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> a <hi>coheire</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Queenes</hi> in all countries. Saints, put them together they are the <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> the <hi>ſpouſe</hi> or <hi>bride</hi> of Chriſt; they are the <hi>Kinred</hi> of Chriſt and divers other relations they have. Now every thing is not <hi>decent</hi> for a <hi>King;</hi> a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred things there are that an ordinarie man may doe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:132715:57"/>that doe not beſeem a <hi>King.</hi> Everything doth not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeme</hi> an <hi>heire:</hi> and there are a hundred things that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may do that doth not <hi>beſeem</hi> a <hi>chaſt bride:</hi> a <hi>chaſt wife.</hi> So there are many things (I may ſay in a ſort) that would not be <hi>unſeemly</hi> for a carnall man, yet they are very <hi>inconvenient</hi> for a Saint to do: therfore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>fooliſh talking and idle jeſting which doe not become Saints;</hi> but in a ſort may become a carnall man; not but that that which is <hi>ill</hi> in a Saint is <hi>ill</hi> in him, but it is not accounted ſo in a carnall man: he may ſit at the alehouſe and drinke halfe a dozen juggs, and be a good fellow: but if a Chriſtian drink but two, carnall men will be readie to ſay, there goes a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,</hi> I ſee him at alehouſes &amp;c. A carnall man may do it; though it be a ſin in him, yet in point of <hi>decencie</hi> a carnall man may ſit two hours at the taverne better then a Chriſtian may halfe an houre.</p>
                  <p>But thou wilt ſay, it is <hi>lawfull</hi> I may doe this, and that; I may <hi>weare,</hi> or I may <hi>eat</hi> this and that.</p>
                  <p>I but is it <hi>decent?</hi> I have told you that ſtorie though it be a morall heathen ſtorie: when the King was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his ſon, and ſaw children playing in the dirt, ſaith he why doeſt not thou goe, and play with them? ſaich he to his father if I did ſee any <hi>Princes</hi> play, I would, but thoſe are roguiſh boyes; It is not for a <hi>Prince</hi> to play with them: So, when you ſee men doe filthy, uncleane ſoule things, ſay, if it did become a <hi>Saint</hi> I would doe ſo; He is a <hi>glorious</hi> creatue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of good and ill; but in lawfull things: you ſee the glorie of a Saint, firſt in his perſon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, looke upon his <hi>relations,</hi> conſider his place that God hath put him in, his <hi>calling,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his relation.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. It may be God hath made him a <hi>miniſter,</hi> it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:132715:58"/>may be a <hi>magiſtrate,</hi> every lawfull thing that becomes an ordinarie man, doth not become a <hi>miniſter,</hi> nor a <hi>magiſtrate.</hi> It may be he is a <hi>ſervant</hi> he muſt conſider, (though it be lawfull) whether it become his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. See one inſtance; <hi>ſervants</hi> are commanded <hi>not to anſwer againe Tit.</hi> 2.9. this <hi>becomes</hi> his place not to anſwer againe. Being a <hi>ſervant:</hi> but for another, if one neighbour ſhould tell another you have done me wrong, I would anſwer I have not, if I were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: but a <hi>ſervant</hi> is forbid to anſwer againe: ſo that it may become one man to doe it, but not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in another condition. There are divers inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but I give you but one.</p>
                  <p>Then thirdly,<note place="margin">3. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Profeſſion.</note> his relation is the <hi>profeſsion</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I ſpake ſome what like it before concerning his perſon: the holy Ghoſt gives that rule <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>I beſeech you brethren that you walk worthy of your calling.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Only, let your converſation be ſuch, as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> Theſe are bleſſed rules for a Saint to walk by; You know that when we turne to the Lord, our <hi>perſons</hi> are not ſo much eyed as our <hi>profeſsion:</hi> therefore if there be any thing amiſs in our <hi>buying,</hi> or <hi>ſelling,</hi> or in our <hi>charitie, profeſsion</hi> ſmarts for it; men are ready to ſay, there is the man that follows <hi>religion,</hi> there is the man that <hi>prayes</hi> in his family, there is the man that <hi>writes</hi> Sermons; there is the <hi>Lady,</hi> or <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> that keeps dayes of <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; Profeſsion</hi> ſuffers for it: Therefore, I muſt eye what is ſeemly for one of ſuch a profeſſion as I am of, to doe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">3. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſex.</note> you muſt eye alſo your relation, for your <hi>ſex</hi> that is to be eyed. Many lawfull things become a man that doe not become a woman, and ſome become
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:132715:59"/>a <hi>woman</hi> that doe not become a <hi>man;</hi> Therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, (which women ſeldome doe,<note place="margin">in regard of ſex.</note> they will ſpeake firſt, and determine things, and order buſineſſes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſidering their ſex,) conſider if it be a decent thing, if you doe that which is convenient, if you doe ſo as <hi>befits</hi> your <hi>ſex,</hi> as well as other circumſtances, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Wives ſubmit your ſelves to your own husbands;</hi> why ſhould wee doe ſo? might they ſay, <hi>as it is fit in the Lord;</hi> that is, it is a decent thing to doe it: though in ſome things they might conteſt, and ſee as much as their husbands, &amp; have more reaſon in their precepts, yet (ſaith he) <hi>ſubmit</hi> as it is <hi>FIT.</hi> It is not <hi>decent</hi> for a woman to rule, and to maſter, and to ſpeak all, &amp; order all, and her husband to be but a drudg;</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, what evill is it, is it unlawfull? O, it is <hi>undecent</hi> to come to a houſe where the woman rules, it is as if people went with their heeles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it is uglie and undecent. So in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. <hi>In like manner alſo let the women adorne themſelves in modeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, with ſhamefaſtnes &amp; ſobrietie, not with broided haire, or gold, or pearles, or coſtly array.</hi> Why? is it not lawful to weare gold, or ſilver? &amp;c I cannot ſay but it is lawfull, but mark what he ſaith next: <hi>but which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh women profeſsing godlines.</hi> There is their <hi>ſex,</hi> and there <hi>profeſſion,</hi> it muſt <hi>become</hi> both. Therefore in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. he wiſheth woman to teach their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands by <hi>ſilence;</hi> if they be godly, and <hi>meek</hi> women, that is the beſt lecture they can read to their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, that they may be wonn by their <hi>chaſt converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe adorning</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let it not be that outward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning of plaiting the haire, and of wearing gold, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of apparrell: but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which in the ſight of God is very
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:132715:60"/>precious.</hi> I will not ſay ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> but it is lawfull to weare <hi>broided haire,</hi> and <hi>gold,</hi> and <hi>pearle:</hi> but it is not an ornament to a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> eye, it is no ornament, no more than to ſee a <hi>Cart-horſe</hi> dreſſed with a leather. To ſee a woman ſpend her time vainely in <hi>trimming:</hi> but this is an ornament, a <hi>meek</hi> ſpirit. An ornament; what is that? That that <hi>beſeems</hi> and <hi>becomes</hi> a woman; it becomes that <hi>ſex,</hi> to ſee a modeſt meek ſpirit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eye the ſex alſo.</p>
                  <p>Then if you will have things decent,<note place="margin">4. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of age</note> eye the <hi>age;</hi> In 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.3 he that wiſheth them not to doe things inconvnient; he teacheth <hi>old</hi> men, and <hi>young</hi> men, and <hi>old</hi> women, and <hi>young</hi> women: ſo that that which is <hi>decent</hi> in <hi>old</hi> men is not <hi>decent</hi> in <hi>young;</hi> it is <hi>decent</hi> for <hi>old</hi> men to <hi>rebuke</hi> the younger: but you muſt <hi>not rebuke an Elder:</hi> it is not fit for a young man to rebuke an Elder. If it be a carnal child it is fit for his <hi>father</hi> to rebuke him for his naughtines: but if he be a godly child he muſt not goe home and wrangle with his <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> you muſt looke to the age.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, looke to the <hi>ſeaſon, every thing is beautifull in its ſeaſon.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">5. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſeaſon.</note> And <hi>a word ſpoken in ſeaſon is like apples of gold with picters of ſilver;</hi> that is; very handſome. So your words and actions muſt be ſeaſonable, or elſe they will never be convenient, There is a time for all things, Therfore in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. The latter end; Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>brethren, it is high time to make you readie, our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is nearer than when we beleived. The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand, let us caſt of the workes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and put on the armor of light; let us walk decently.</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> It is <hi>decently</hi> in the margine; it is <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly</hi> in the booke) <hi>as in the day time.</hi> As if hee had ſayd, heretofore it was <hi>night,</hi> and <hi>darknes,</hi> there was little knowledg, and little preaching of the Goſpel:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:132715:60"/>in the night men weare any foule cloathes, but in the <hi>day</hi> it is not <hi>decent</hi> for a man to walk with the cloathes of the <hi>night:</hi> therfore put of your <hi>night capps,</hi> and weare cleane cloathes, walk decently as in the day, looke to the time, frame your converſations accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that. And that I conceive the Apoſtle drives at Ephes. 5. Where hee commands us to walke <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> I rather like the tranſlation we have <hi>Circumſpectly,</hi> becauſe it hath better coherence with the text, <hi>See that you walk circumſpectly, not as fooles: but as wiſe, redeeming the time, becauſe the dayes are evil.</hi> I ſee nor how becauſe the dayes are evil, we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the time by walking <hi>ſtrictly:</hi> but walk <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly,</hi> fit your opportunity and time, obſerve it, take nitice of it. As indeed what bad times were there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout halfe a ſcore yeares agoe: men were faine to watch opportunities to <hi>pray,</hi> and to goe to <hi>Sermons,</hi> or to <hi>faſts;</hi> So walk <hi>decently,</hi> that is, <hi>ſerve the times,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve opportunities <hi>Ro.</hi> 12. take notice of every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to doe things <hi>fitly,</hi> and <hi>ſeaſonably,</hi> I onely give a few inſtances. So you underſtand <hi>All things are lawfull, but all things are not expedient:</hi> that is, all lawful things are not convenient, they are not <hi>decent,</hi> it may be they are not <hi>ſeaſonable.</hi> It may be that fits an <hi>old</hi> man that doth not fit a <hi>young;</hi> It may be it is fit for the <hi>husband,</hi> that doth not befit the <hi>wife;</hi> it may be it is no harme in a carnall man, that doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeem one that is a <hi>profeſſor</hi> of religion. Thus you muſt walk, thus it becometh Saints to walk, you muſt look to <hi>decency,</hi> and <hi>conveniency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third rule,<note place="margin">Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, muſt walk laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</note> or expreſſions to order things that are not determined, they are many, but they all come to this, they imply a thing <hi>laudable,</hi> or <hi>commendable,</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:132715:61"/>that is a degree higher: for <hi>decency</hi> is a thing that keeps us, that we doe not diſparage our ſelves in our <hi>relations,</hi> and make us <hi>worſe:</hi> but wee are called upon to walk <hi>laudably;</hi> not only, not to caſt dirt on religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but to bring honour, and to add glory to it; not only, not to diſgrace it; but ſo to walk that <hi>the eye that ſeeth us,</hi> and <hi>the eare that heareth us may bleſſe us. Let no rotten communication proceed out of your mouthes: but that that may miniſter grace.</hi> Not grace to the ſoul: but that it may be <hi>gracious,</hi> and <hi>lovely,</hi> and <hi>amiable;</hi> I will ſhew you but one place, the glorious golden rule of the Saints walking in the new Teſtament, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. where the Apoſtle coming to ſpeak of ordering their converſation, ſaith he, <hi>Finally brethren, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; If there be any vertue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Things true what.</note> 
                     <hi>if there be any praiſe, think of theſe things.</hi> Doe theſe things, meditate on theſe things. Whatſoever things are <hi>true,</hi> I conceive that the meaning is this, I look on theſe things, not as if the Apoſtle did give rules of <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>evil:</hi> but ſets down an excellent way for indifferent things, <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are true;</hi> If there be any thing that carries no reſemblance of deceit and falſhood, take that: but if it be a buſines that you muſt <hi>ſay,</hi> and <hi>unſay,</hi> and <hi>doe,</hi> &amp; <hi>undoe,</hi> that you muſt be both an <hi>honeſt</hi> man, and a <hi>knave,</hi> meddle not with that, though it be lawfull, let it be for another.<note place="margin">Things honeſt what.</note> And <hi>whatſoever things are honeſt,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are <hi>grave;</hi> as the Originall is, or <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> as it is in your margine: for there is honeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>honeſtus</hi> is as much as <hi>honorabilis,</hi> whatſoever is <hi>grave,</hi> and <hi>venerable,</hi> that doe. A Saint ſhould have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:132715:61"/>ſuch gravity in him, that he ſhould avoid any thing that is beneath him. A Saint is a glorious creature, he is an heire of heaven, they are the ſons and daughters of God; every little childiſh thing becomes not him. Therefore <hi>gravity</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>lightneſſe,</hi> and <hi>frothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> He goes farther, <hi>If any thing be pure.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Things pare what.</note> There are many things that you cannot ſay are <hi>unlawful,</hi> yet there are many <hi>druggs</hi> among them that are like <hi>ſin,</hi> I could give inſtances; there are many nooks, and nicks, and carriages that are like ſin, that are mingled. O, if a thing be <hi>pure,</hi> take that; if it be <hi>honeſt,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>true,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Things lovely.</note> take that. <hi>Whatſoever things are lovely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are of good report, If there be any vertue, or any praiſe doe that.</hi> To ſpeak briefly, and plainly, there are many hundreds of lawfull things that are not <hi>love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> for a Saint; I could name divers; Is it not lawfull to doe this, and that? it is lawfull, but it is not <hi>lovely;</hi> a Saint ſhould doe nothing but that which is <hi>lovely. And whatſoever is of good report.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of good report.</note> A young-man and a <hi>maid</hi> may be in an <hi>ale-houſe,</hi> or a <hi>Taverne,</hi> I doe not ſay it it unlawful, if they be honeſt there: but it is not <hi>lovely,</hi> it is not of <hi>good report,</hi> people <hi>talk</hi> not well of ſuch things. So you have twenty words in buying and ſelling, and you will aske twenty ſhillings, and take halfe ſo much, and ſay, is it not lawful? I ſay, it is not <hi>lovely;</hi> it is not <hi>lovely</hi> in the eye of a <hi>Turk</hi> for a <hi>Profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> to ask twenty for that for which he will take ten. The Apoſtle goes on, <hi>if their be any vertue, or praiſe;</hi> that is, if there be any thing that carries <hi>praiſe</hi> to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or that ſeems to have vertue, or excellency, or worth in it, keep to thoſe things, meditate upon them, goe about them; though not for the praiſe ſake.<note place="margin">Praiſe worthy.</note> VVe do not a thing that hath praiſe in it to have the praiſe,

So the end of my actions muſt not be to <hi>get praiſe,</hi> yet I muſt chooſe (as becometh a Saint) to doe thoſe actions that have <hi>praiſe,</hi> and vertue in them, the praiſe muſt be to God, and to religion, and it will be to the doer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Therefore, what is this now that <hi>all things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but all things are not expedient?</hi> That is, all lawful things are not <hi>true,</hi> they are not <hi>pure,</hi> they are not <hi>love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> they are not of <hi>good report,</hi> all lawfull things have not <hi>vertue</hi> in them; many lawfull things bring no <hi>praiſe:</hi> this is the meaning of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there is one word more,<note place="margin">Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt walk or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly.</note> all <hi>lawfull</hi> things are not <hi>expedient;</hi> that is, as they doe not conduce to the <hi>profit</hi> and good of others, they are not <hi>conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> they are not <hi>laudable</hi> and <hi>commendable:</hi> So laſtly, it comprehends this, they are not <hi>orderly,</hi> that is the laſt rule. Every <hi>lawfull</hi> thing is not <hi>orderly:</hi> we break <hi>order</hi> many times in doing of lawfull things. The Apoſtle ſummes up all in this, <hi>Let every thing be done decently, and in ORDER.</hi> I ſpeak, not only that wee are to doe things <hi>orderly</hi> that Chriſt hath <hi>inſtituted,</hi> though that be true, yet that is not my drift: but in things that are not <hi>determined,</hi> they muſt be done <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,</hi> and not confuſedly. As the thiefe on the croſſe ſaid concerning Chriſt, that he did nothing out of its place; that is, hee did not only not doe evil: but hee did not doe good in a <hi>diſorderly</hi> way. So in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:132715:62"/>we are ſaid to be waſhed by Chriſt, and to be without, <hi>ſpot or wrinckle;</hi> every thing in the meet place of it. So a Chriſtian ſhould walk <hi>orderly,</hi> not only in that which is good: but in <hi>indifferent</hi> things.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, What is it to walk <hi>orderly?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beloved, you croſſe <hi>order,</hi> and doe lawfull things <hi>diſorderly,</hi> when you doe them either <hi>prepoſterouſly</hi> or <hi>confuſedly.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If I were not deſirous to make an end of this I could prove the doctrine (though it need not much proofe) by <hi>ſcripture,</hi> and by parallelling it with other things, with <hi>naturall</hi> things. As in the Civill law, many things are <hi>lawfull</hi> that are not <hi>convenient;</hi> it is <hi>lawful</hi> for me to keep my child barer in apparrell than my ſervant; but it is not <hi>convenient.</hi> It is lawfull to keep my ſervant, better than my wife, but it is not convenient: It is lawfull for a man to ſleepe all day and to work all night, (I meane by the lawes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) but it is not <hi>convenient.</hi> There are abundance of things that are <hi>lawfull</hi> for the ſaints that are no way <hi>expedient</hi> for them to doe, But I paſſe that, and haſten to the <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>application,</hi> briefely a word at this time, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>From this that hath been ſaid, learne this uſe,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:132715:63"/>which is the Third doctrine but for brevitie I make it the <hi>uſe</hi> or the <hi>application</hi> Of all: that this being ſo, that every thing that is <hi>lawfull</hi> is not <hi>expedient;</hi> then it is the dutie of Chriſtians to <hi>eye,</hi> and <hi>obſerve,</hi> not <hi>only</hi> (I had almoſt ſaid not ſo much, but certainly not <hi>only</hi>) to <hi>eye</hi> what is <hi>lawfull,</hi> but in all their waies to looke what is, <hi>expedient;</hi> that is, to ſee that it be <hi>orderly, convenient, laudable, lovely,</hi> &amp; of <hi>good report,</hi> elſe, though it be <hi>lawfull,</hi> meddle not with it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall ſee that the Apoſtle in all theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the ſeaventh Chapter to the middle of the eleaventh as you have many queſtions, and in all or moſt of thoſe, the Apoſtle diverts the queſtion. They aske him if it were <hi>lawfull</hi> to <hi>marrie?</hi> and being <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,</hi> if it were <hi>lawfull</hi> to put <hi>away</hi> their <hi>wives?</hi> and if it were <hi>lawfull</hi> to eat <hi>meat</hi> offered to <hi>Idoles?</hi> The Apoſtle doth not punctually anſwer to one of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were <hi>lawfull</hi> or no, but ſhewes what was <hi>conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid; in all theſe, and whatſoever elſe, <hi>eye</hi> what is <hi>convenient,</hi> and <hi>expedient,</hi> as much, and ſometimes <hi>more</hi> than what is <hi>lawfull.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore this being ſo, this points out clearly a generall fault among you. That there are many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors among us, this is the rule of their walking, they only <hi>eye</hi> what is <hi>lawfull,</hi> and what is <hi>unlawfull;</hi> they goe about, and trouble every miniſter, and make endleſſe queſtions, Is this <hi>lawful</hi> and is that? is it <hi>lawfull</hi> to play at <hi>Tables,</hi> and at <hi>Cards</hi> and to weare long <hi>haire</hi> and naked <hi>breaſts?</hi> I will not diſpute the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe but I pray thee <hi>eye</hi> if it be <hi>ſeemly,</hi> and of <hi>good report</hi> among the Saints, whether it be <hi>convenient,</hi> whether it <hi>advance</hi> any bodies <hi>good, eye</hi> this.

I have three words to ſay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. It is a ſigne of an hypocrite.</note>Firſt, I ſay to ſuch people, that uſually, it is the ſigne of an <hi>hypocrit,</hi> (though it be not a certaine ſigne, it is a very ſhrewd one:) it is a ſigne of a <hi>hollow heart</hi> that was never right to God, that <hi>eyes</hi> only what is <hi>lawfull,</hi> to doe it, and <hi>unlawfull</hi> to avoid it: it is a ſigne of a baſe heart that will do no more than needs muſt. Why? It is a ſigne that there is no <hi>love</hi> to God, he will <hi>doe</hi> ſo much as God flatly <hi>commands,</hi> and <hi>avoid</hi> that that God <hi>forbids,</hi> or elſe he knowes he ſhall be damned: but a heart full of <hi>love</hi> will alway be asking, what is <hi>pleaſing,</hi> and <hi>ſeemly.</hi> A <hi>drudg</hi> or ſervant in the houſe hates her maſter, and had as live be hanged as to ſerve him, if ſhee knew how, but ſhee muſt: but a <hi>wife</hi> that loves her husband dearely, will ſhee doe every thing that ſhee may? ſhee may goe to bed, and lie til noone if ſhe will: he will not be angrie with her; and though her husband bid her doe nothing, yet ſhee will ſtudie what is <hi>lovely,</hi> and <hi>decent,</hi> and <hi>comely,</hi> &amp; <hi>pleaſing,</hi> and will not he take it kindly when he comes
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:132715:64"/>home? O, there is no <hi>love</hi> in thee, a thouſand to one but thou haſt an <hi>hypocriticall</hi> heart: for if there were <hi>love</hi> to God, thou wouldeſt never ſtand ſo much upon <hi>lawfull,</hi> and <hi>unlawfull,</hi> as what is <hi>decent,</hi> and <hi>comely</hi> &amp;c. hypocrites will goe as neare hell as they can, that is their deſigne, and the readie way thither is to goe to <hi>lawfull</hi> things only, and not things <hi>expedient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well Secondly,<note place="margin">2. It is a ſigne of an old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> if it be not the ſigne of an <hi>hypocrit</hi> (for I cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſay certainly it is) yet it is a ſigne of an <hi>old Teſtament ſpirit;</hi> divers of you rightly underſtand not that word, it ſounds harſh to you, &amp; if you be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers I wonder not at it: but if you be thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually heare me open the old Teſtament; &amp; how our fathers were ſaved by the ſame <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by the ſame <hi>Covenant</hi> that we are, &amp;c. I wonder that you ſhould ſtumble; for as you underſtand the book of God, in reading it, you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare one thing with another: ſo you muſt underſtand mens preaching, comparing one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with another. Now when I ſay an <hi>old Teſtament ſpirit,</hi> I mean not another kind of thing than is the ſpirit of the <hi>new Teſtament:</hi> an <hi>old Teſtament ſpirit</hi> is the ſame, but onely it is a <hi>low</hi> ſpirit, a <hi>childiſh</hi> ſpirit; the difference is as between a <hi>childe</hi> in his coates, &amp; a <hi>man</hi> of riper yeares, it is the ſame man ſtill: but it was a <hi>lower</hi> ſpirit, meaner principles, and they walked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: ſo that for the generallity for them (unleſſe it were ſome choice ſpirits, that were the Pen-men of the holy Ghoſt;) they were children under tutors: ſo an <hi>old Teſtament ſpirit</hi> is a <hi>low</hi> mean ſpirit, that walks as thoſe godly people in their <hi>child-hood</hi> in the <hi>old-Teſtament,</hi> that is my meaning; therefore miſtake me not. Now, when I ſay thou art lead by an <hi>old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpirit,</hi> I mean, thou haſt a heart fitter to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:132715:65"/>the <hi>law</hi> (in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when they were <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and <hi>babies,</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> under <hi>tutors,</hi> than for the times of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> Such a heart doth every thing as far as it is <hi>lawfull:</hi> So, many things are <hi>lawfull,</hi> and he will doe them, or ſo many are <hi>unlawfull,</hi> and hee will avoid them: For under the <hi>Law</hi> the Lord told them every thing, what was lawfull and what was not, and he made them little lawes, as we doe to our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for feare of cutting their fingers, or for going over a bridge, &amp;c. But it is not ſo now; remember the rule <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. <hi>If there be any thing that is lovely, or of good report,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. A man may be damned for doing of lawfull things.</note> 
                     <hi>or hath praiſe, or vertue, doe that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, I ſay this to ſuch (for thy comfort, if thou wilt have it ſo) that thou maieſt <hi>looſe</hi> thy ſoule forever, and be <hi>damned</hi> in hell for doing of <hi>lawful</hi> things: not for doing <hi>lawful</hi> things, but for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in a way, thou maieſt go and ſtrive to avoid <hi>ill,</hi> and to doe <hi>good,</hi> and in a way of doing <hi>lawful</hi> things thou maieſt goe to hell, much more in unlawfull; my meaning is, when men eye only lawfull things, and never look what is <hi>convenient,</hi> they may goe to hell in doing it. Have you not heard of a Proverb <hi>licitis perimus,</hi> &amp;c. Saith the heathen, we periſh in <hi>lawful</hi> things? I have known many profeſſors that have gone ſuch wayes that men might clearely ſay, yonder is an old back-ſliding profeſſor, that goes directly to hell; yet he will ſay, convince me of evil. It may be I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in point of lawfulneſs; yet I know he walks not <hi>honourably,</hi> he brings not glory to God as a Saint of the new Teſtament ſhould, he walks <hi>low,</hi> and carnally, and meanly, every day more and more. A man may avoid the reproofe of unlawfulnes, and yet goe every day towards hell, it is ordinarie, and he is blinde that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:132715:65"/>ſees it not. It is the caſe of ſome here I feare that the people of God generally conceive they are in a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding condition, and one ſaith to ſuch a one I feare you are going from the Lord, and that you have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſpirit than you had, and another gives him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, and he falls upon them all, and ſaith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me, and ſo waves all reproofe, and hee may doe ſo, and be damned when he hath done. It follows not that thou art in a happy condition, becauſe thou art able to wave and to winde off reproofe, thou maieſt keep off reproofe, and yet be in a backſliding condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and going to the devill.</p>
                  <p>I have heard of a godly Miniſter that hath another expreſſion; a man may be <hi>damned,</hi> and thrown to hell for doing of <hi>juſtice,</hi> for ſeeking of his own; As there is a man <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. though it be but a Parable; his Lord <hi>forgives</hi> him his debt; and he comes and takes another man by the throat, and caſts him into priſon, hee did him no wrong; Why ſhould he couzen me of my money? But the Lord comes and throws the man into the place of torment, not for doing unlawfull things properly: for he asked but his own; So, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times a rich man that is worth tenthouſand pound he takes a poore creature that is not able to pay any thing, and throws him into Priſon, and then ſaith, he oweth me ſo much; doe I doe him any wrong? have I it not in black and white? ſhall I not ask for my own; thou maieſt doe right, and ſeek thy due, and yet be damned; Is it not lawfull thou wilt ſay? I cannot ſay but it is lawfull: but thou walkeſt not as a Saint, it is not <hi>lovely,</hi> it is not <hi>decent,</hi> it is not <hi>expedient.</hi> I feare there are many ſuch profeſſors; think of this: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now in the new Teſtament, ſeek not what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:132715:66"/>only, but what is <hi>venerable,</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>decent,</hi> and <hi>comely,</hi> for a Saint to doe; That is one Uſe.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, the next Uſe, and the laſt that I ſhall make at this time,<note place="margin">The way of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel a ſtrict way.</note> is this, Learne hence what a <hi>ſtrict</hi> way the way of the Goſpel is; it is no way of <hi>liberty,</hi> or <hi>looſnes</hi> you have bin thinking all this while that I have been making of a way of <hi>looſnes</hi> or <hi>liſcentiouſnes</hi>

                     </gap> ſee hence it is a <hi>ſtrict</hi> way: for though there be very <hi>many</hi> things <hi>lawfull,</hi> more than you imagine; yet there are but a <hi>few</hi> that are <hi>expedient;</hi> and whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Goſpel makes the way broader in point of <hi>lawfulnes,</hi> it fetcheth it out againe in point of <hi>expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie.</hi> Take two profeſſors, the one of an <hi>old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpirit</hi> that lookes only to that which is <hi>lawfull,</hi> and let him be as <hi>ſtrict</hi> as hee can for his life in doing that which is <hi>lawfull,</hi> and avoiding that which is <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> or elſe he ſhall be damned.

                  <p>But you will ſay, wherein will he be ſtrict, ſhall he doe works of <hi>ſupererogation?</hi> ſhall he make duties as the papiſts doe? if God have not bound and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, what pleaſure hath God in that he doth?</p>
                  <p>I anſwere, there are but a <hi>few</hi> things that God hath <hi>commanded</hi> in the <hi>new Teſtament;</hi> but there are ſome things that he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that are abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in themſelves, but when I ſay he is not bound, I meane, not to the thing ſimplie, to take that way, or
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:132715:66"/>to doe that thing: but there is nothing in the world, when it comes to be done, when it comes to action, and is covered with all circumſtances, but it is either <hi>expedient</hi> or not, and when a thing becomes <hi>expedient;</hi> and is ſo preſented to a Saint, then though he be not bound to the thing ſimplie, yet he is bound to it when it becomes <hi>expedient:</hi> According to diſcourſe, men ſay, by the rule of nature, much more by the law of the Goſpel, in two things that are both <hi>lawfull,</hi> if one be more <hi>expedient</hi> than the other wee are bound to doe that. Therefore it is no <hi>ſupererogation,</hi> or following of his fancie, but that that is commanded of God, though he had not <hi>determined</hi> it ſimplie before, yet when it comes to action he is bound to doe it: for that very thing at another time may be caſt ſo, that he ſins abſolutely if he doth it not. Here is the myſtery, all <hi>expedient, decent</hi> things, I am not looſe to doe them or not doe them: but of all <hi>expedient</hi> things that that is beſt at that time, <hi>hic et nunc,</hi> I am bound to doe it: Therfore it is not a way of <hi>looſenes</hi> nor of <hi>ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but we are bound though not in a legall way (to the thing ſimplie in it ſelf) as they were in the old Teſtament.</p>

                  <p>Wert thou ſo mad all this while, as to think that this <hi>liberty,</hi> was only a greater liberty for thee to be wicked, and ſinfull, and for thy luſts? I hope thou do'ſt not meane ſo; it is not ſo; liberty to ſin is bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: but it is a liberty to good, in doing good; not a liberty properly for the eaſe of our perſons, (though
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:132715:67"/>that be ſomewhat) for there is many a Saint under the new Teſtament in doing that that is <hi>expedient,</hi> works as hard as the <hi>Levites</hi> in ſlaying of the cattell: but hee works not <hi>task</hi> work, as they did. So the <hi>liberty</hi> is not that thou maieſt doe leſſe <hi>good,</hi> or more <hi>evil:</hi> but the liberty is this, that now God allowes thee to doe good in a more <hi>honourable</hi> way to thy ſelf, and more advantagious to the honour of God; that is all: As for inſtance, you know an <hi>apprentice</hi> that is with his maſter, he is bound, he is not a free-man, he doth the buſines of his maſter, and works hard too: now, when the man comes to be a free-man, to be a houſe keeper, and ſet up his trade, this freedom doth not make him doe leſſe than he did before: for the Proverb is, there is but one ſervant in a houſe, that is the maſter, hee hath more <hi>charge,</hi> and <hi>care,</hi> but he doth it in a more honourable way as a free-man, and not as a drudg; So the Lord doth with us, he hath broken the little lawes that bound us as children; we muſt ſerve him as much and more than we did before, but in a more <hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> way, for our <hi>honour,</hi> and the advancement of his glory.</p>
                  <p>As for inſtance, if a man ſend a <hi>childe</hi> or a <hi>foole</hi> to market to buy or ſell commodities, you muſt tell him the price of every thing, and charg him that he ſhall not ſell it under, and tell him when he ſhall come home, and who ſhall help him; but ſend a <hi>wiſe</hi> man thither, and you bind him not with thoſe lawes, but you ſay, thou knoweſt what it coſt, make the beſt of thy market, and come when thou canſt, he hath his freedome, and yet he will doe more than the other: ſo there is advantage for the maſter and honour for the ſervant; and though the ſervant doth as much
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:132715:67"/>when he is a free man as he did before; yet we natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally love not to be under <hi>childiſh</hi> diſcipline: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a great priviledg that we are freed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, &amp; ſuch a priviledge that it is a ſtep to perfection in <hi>heaven.</hi> In heaven we ſhall ſerve God as the Angels, and I thinke not that the Angels are tied with little <hi>lawes, endles, externall</hi> lawes, but it is their nature, and diſpoſition to ſerve God unweariedly world without end: ſo that as we are aſtep to heaven above that that was under the law, ſo that thoſe bonds are broken, and there is a new Covenant in the ſtead of them: ſo when we ſhall goe up with Chriſt, many,<note place="margin">Uſe of the Goſpels eaſineſſe.</note> if not all theſe that we have now ſhall be broken, and ſhall be tranſlated into our nature. Therefore what I ſay concerning the <hi>eaſines</hi> of the way to heaven, I meane not that thou ſhouldeſt make that uſe of it, it is <hi>eaſie</hi> therefore I may be careleſſe, and do it when I will: but it is <hi>eaſie</hi> therefore I will take more paines to doe it. As I have ſeene when I was a boy at ſchoole, two children take the ſame leſſon, and both have ſaid it was an eaſie leſſon; it is an eaſie leſſon ſaith the one, I will doe this after dinner, when I have played enough; ſaith the other it is eaſie, therefore I will not be diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but ſet upon it: they made a contrary uſe of it. So it is an <hi>eaſie;</hi> and ſweet way to heaven in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Chriſt hath made, be not ſo wicked to ſay, therefore I will do it time enough: when I am readie to die, it will be time enough, but as the other ſaid, it is <hi>eaſie</hi> therefore I wil not be diſcouraged by the grace of God: it is a wide doore therefore I wiil goe in preſently, I will not be diſheartned.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:132715:68"/>keep your ſelves as <hi>looſe</hi> from the <hi>former</hi> as God hath left you, and ſtrive as <hi>ſtrictly</hi> as you can to obſerve the <hi>latter:</hi> for then you will be excellent Chriſtians moſt of you, if you would doe <hi>leſſe</hi> out of <hi>lawfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>more</hi> out of <hi>expediency.</hi> Whereas now you cannot goe about any thing to doe it, unleſſe you have an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute command; and when you have done that task you never looke farther; beware of that, in every action, though it be <hi>lawfull,</hi> doe it not, till you can ſet about it <hi>decently,</hi> and <hi>orderly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>You may conceive that it is but a ſmall thing, and a notion; yet I know, and am able (I think) to make it good, that the want of this is one of the chiefeſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries on your ſouls, eſpecially in reſpect of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation each to other; therefore to ſet on this duty upon mine own ſoule, and yours, I will propoſe three or foure weightie motives; It will be ſtrange to many of you, and it will be harſh to fleſh and blood: nature will do ſomething if it be bound, but if it be let looſe, if God have not abſolutely bound it, it will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Therefore;</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Motive 1. It would end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies among the Saints.</note>The firſt motive is this, that this I conceive if you apprehend it ſpiritually, it would be the readieſt way in the world to <hi>reconcile</hi> the <hi>Saints,</hi> and to <hi>end</hi> many, if not moſt of thoſe <hi>controverſies</hi> that are at this day among good people: And this was the chiefeſt end why I took this text in hand; therefore I ſhall ſpeak a little more largely of this: For now the godly goe one againſt another, and all <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> every one will have an abſolute rule for all the Saints, and every
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:132715:69"/>one will make the beſt of their game, and ſo ſcrew and wreſt the Scriptures; and I think, all the people that ſtrive in theſe dayes are guilty of this.</p>
                  <p>How ſhall we doe to have <hi>peace</hi> among the Saints?</p>
                  <p>Let us agree upon cleare undoubted <hi>rules</hi> (that are not many) about the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God, about <hi>doctrine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The way to peace.</note> &amp; <hi>diſcipline,</hi> that we may be able to ſtop the mouthes of men by Scripture: let us agree, (as eaſily we might if this truth were written in our hearts) for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rules that are plaine and abſolute: that I cannot only prove that it was done by the Saints of old, and commanded: but ſo done and commanded, as that it is an <hi>abſolute rule</hi> for <hi>all</hi> Saints in <hi>all</hi> ages. And what ſhall wee doe for the reſt? Doe as it is <hi>decent,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,</hi> and as it may <hi>edifie</hi> &amp;c. And all the ſtrife would be over; if wee did agree on that, and walk ſo far together, wee ſhould eaſily judge after, what were <hi>expedient,</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> to be done.</p>
                  <p>As for inſtance in two caſes; There is now among good people a great deale of ſtrife about <hi>baptiſme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Baptiſme.</note> as for divers things, ſo for the point of <hi>dipping</hi> (though in ſome places in <hi>England,</hi> they dipp altogether;) How ſhall we end the controverſie with thoſe godly people? (as many of them are) Look upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and there you ſhall finde, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to <hi>baptize,</hi> it is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, and the uſe of water, in way of waſhing for a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> end, to reſemble ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall thing: It is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, but whether <hi>dipping</hi> or <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> that we muſt bring the partie to a <hi>River,</hi> or draw the <hi>River</hi> to him, or uſe water at <hi>home,</hi> whether hee muſt be in <hi>head,</hi> and <hi>foot,</hi> or be <hi>under</hi> the water, or the water under <hi>him;</hi> it is not proved that God hath laid down an abſolute rule for it. Now,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:132715:69"/>what ſhall we doe? conclude on the <hi>abſolute rule,</hi> that God hath laid downe in Scripture, and judge of the reſt according to <hi>expediency;</hi> Take the maine rule, which is this, <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, that is, the uſing of water upon believers for a ſpirituall end; then comes in the caſe of <hi>expediency,</hi> then let us judge whether <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> or <hi>dipping,</hi> be more <hi>expedient,</hi> and then there would be no ſtrife: For there is ſcarce a man in this place, that if he were perſwaded that <hi>dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> were not an abſolute rule; but it were to be judged according to <hi>expediency,</hi> he would rather have in a modeſt way the uſe of water, than to have men and women, and weak people (it may be) in the winter time over <hi>head</hi> and <hi>eares</hi> into the <hi>River;</hi> hee would rather make uſe of water in a more civill, and ſafe, and leſſe dangerous way. I give you but an inſtance.</p>
                  <p>And ſo for that other great controverſie that is amongſt godly people; that is, (as you call them) <hi>Independents,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> there is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie amongſt theſe godly people.</p>
                  <p>I know alſo by the way that there are a companie of people that would arrogate the name of <hi>Presbyterie</hi> though improperly,<note place="margin">Falſe Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> the name doth not beſeeme them, that is, thoſe that have been the <hi>Biſhops</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and are all for <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>fagot,</hi> there are ſome ſuch among us &amp; they would arrogate the name of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> I would not have them doe it, it doth not befit them. But it is a deviſe of the devill to put nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names, upon people and upon things in all ages. Nay, I will tell you a greater myſtery, one of the cheifeſt things I mourne for in <hi>England:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Devil puts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary names up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men &amp;c. things</note> what is that? the devill doth not only put ſoule names on things, but he calls things not only by <hi>different,</hi> but by <hi>contrarie</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:132715:70"/>names; he calls one thing by the name of another, as to call a <hi>knife</hi> a <hi>ſpoone,</hi> and a <hi>ſpoone</hi> a <hi>knife,</hi> ſo he takes <hi>good</hi> names, and puts them upon <hi>foule</hi> things, and puts <hi>foule</hi> names upon <hi>good</hi> things; ſo he jumbles things, and drives all among the common people, ſo it may be there are ſome that would take the name of <hi>presbytery;</hi> ſo, that if we looke upon the nature of the thing, as godly men, and as the word of god deſcribes it, it is farr from it. But concerning theſe I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, only I ſeeke <hi>peace with all:</hi> but I ſhall hope to reconcile the Saints, and theſe people, when the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the <hi>ſerpent,</hi> and the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the <hi>woman</hi> are reconciled.</p>
                  <p>But the true <hi>presbyterie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">True Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</note> that take the name conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſly, and rationally, they are godly people, and I ſhall ſpeak a word tending to peace betweene them, and the godly that are called <hi>Independents.</hi> How ſhall I doe that from this doctrine? The true <hi>Presbyterie</hi> (not as I conceit or according to mens fancie, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their writing, and books, and profeſſion of godly learned men) I find not that in any thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt they <hi>diſſent</hi> from that that you call <hi>independency,</hi> till you come to one thing; for they agree that the Church muſt be a companie of <hi>Saints,</hi> and that there is <hi>power</hi> in Chruch-<hi>Ordinances</hi> as long as they doe it well: but here is all the difference, that godly, ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, conſciencious men lay down,<note place="margin">Difference between Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> betweene <hi>Presbyterie</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> that the one, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> they ſay that when any <hi>Church</hi> doth <hi>amiſſe,</hi> and cannot agree, and doe things <hi>orderly,</hi> they would <hi>appeale</hi> to godly <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and they ſhould judge the buſines, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine among them. No ſay the <hi>Independents,</hi> we will only goe to them for <hi>councell</hi> and <hi>adviſe,</hi> but they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:132715:70"/>ſhall have no power to <hi>determine</hi> the buſines. This is the difference between the conſciencious <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> for others that perſecute with fire and fagot, I account them not the <hi>Presbyterie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ſhall we doe in this caſe?</p>
                  <p>I tell you, it is fit, as I conceive, that we ſhould <hi>all</hi> walk together by the ſame <hi>rule</hi> as far as we have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;<note place="margin">To walke all by the ſame rule as far as wee have warrant.</note> we agree in all the <hi>maine</hi> things, let us <hi>walk</hi> ſo till we come to that one that they differ in, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one if ever we come to it; the ſtrife among Gods people of <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Independencie,</hi> would ceaſe (take away thoſe that ſtrive to make bate) It is as if you and I ſhould ſtrive who ſhould goe into the gates of <hi>Venice</hi> firſt, and a hundred to one if any of us come there. Let us goe along in the ſubſtantiall things wherein we agree. And what ſhall we doe then? I tell you as, for the matter of <hi>appeale,</hi> the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> truly called as they cannot fully prove, that there is an abſolute <hi>rule</hi> that they <hi>ſhould</hi> doe ſo; ſo, the other cannot prove that they may <hi>not.</hi> What is to be done then? This, that when all things come to that that they cannot agree in a Church, it may be <hi>expedient,</hi> and <hi>convenient,</hi> that we appeale to others to end our buſines; if this were done, downe would goe the <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and <hi>Independents.</hi> This is the way to peace, and union, and agreement among the Saints.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, Sir, this is the way to <hi>confuſion:</hi> for there being but a <hi>few</hi> things <hi>lawfull,</hi> and <hi>abundance</hi> of things that are not <hi>expedient,</hi> now who ſhall judge what is <hi>expedient,</hi> and what is <hi>not?</hi> ſhall every <hi>particular</hi> man <hi>determine</hi> of his owne head? then there will be a <hi>confuſion</hi> worſe than ever: for ſo many men, ſo many
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:132715:71"/>minds, therefore ſurely this is not the way to peace.</p>
                  <p>To anſwer that (to take in ſome obiections as I paſſe) to cleare the truth, I muſt tell you foure or five things.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is,<note place="margin">1. Take heed of vaine feares in Gods wayes.</note> that if this be the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (which I hope I have proved to you) then take heed of your wiſedome that runns, and ſees inconveniences in Gods wayes. Feare it not, if it be Gods <hi>way</hi> God can perſerve it, and bleſſe it; feare not inconveniences in your vaine thoughts, leave the event to the Lord. As you know that unhappie man <hi>Uzzah,</hi> when he ſaw the Arke ſhake, he muſt goe and hold it. When you are ſure that this is the will of God, ſet not your wits on work as people doe, they reaſon from <hi>intricacies,</hi> and <hi>abſurdities,</hi> and this and that that may follow: It is good to be <hi>ſober,</hi> and not to be <hi>curious</hi> when we ſee clearly that this is the will of God, leave it to the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>direct</hi> them, and <hi>guide</hi> them, and bleſſe them as he pleaſeth. That is one anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. Chriſt hath done the maine already concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note>Secondly you ſay, it will be all <hi>confuſion, who</hi> ſhall judge, ſhall every <hi>particular</hi> man? This is the ſecond anſwer, It is very probable, if every man ſhall goe and ſet up what <hi>government</hi> he will, and <hi>worſhip</hi> God as he <hi>pleaſeth;</hi> if all the worſhip of God were to be <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> according to <hi>every</hi> mans <hi>humour,</hi> or every <hi>nation,</hi> and <hi>cuſtome,</hi> and <hi>faſhion,</hi> then it would breed confuſion, but Chriſt hath done that for the maine; the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is done, and the <hi>matter,</hi> nay the <hi>manner</hi> and forme in a great meaſure; nay, it may be ſome <hi>circumſtances.</hi> But if all were to be done againe, that we were to <hi>ſhape,</hi> a <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>cuſtomes</hi> and <hi>lawes</hi> wholly, and as a Godly Ancient ſaith, if we were to frame the houſe to the <hi>curtaine,</hi> and not the <hi>curtaine</hi> to the <hi>houſe,</hi> If we

To ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things.</note> it is probable, that in caſe wee ſhould goe on thus, according to the rules, agreeing in the cleare generall rules, and goe accordingly in particulars, as is <hi>expedient;</hi> yet it is to be doubted that according to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> we have now, and our <hi>temper,</hi> wee ſhall goe to greater <hi>confuſion;</hi> and ſo wee ſhall as long as wee have <hi>carnall</hi> ſleight ſpirits, (as generally Chriſtians have) they will lead us to <hi>confuſion.</hi>

                  <p>As firſt, they may <hi>determine</hi> in <hi>neceſſary indefferent</hi> things: As thus, for inſtance,<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>That is the reaſon that we blame the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> they ſay, they are <hi>indifferent</hi> things, the <hi>Surplice</hi> is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, if it were a <hi>neceſſary indifferent</hi> thing they might urge it, but there is no <hi>neceſsity</hi> of it; Therefore men muſt obſerve that rule, or elſe they will run end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely,

                  <p>I wil add one more, and I ſhall go no farther at this time; and that is, if you will avoid <hi>confuſion</hi> herein, and follow this truth. You know I have ſhewed you certaine rules by which you ſhould goe to avoide <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,</hi> and they are as <hi>Land marks,</hi> or as <hi>booyes</hi> in the water to guide you.

                  <p>But it may be, you will ſay, thoſe rules will not reach every caſe, therefore I ſhall be at a ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to them I will add three or foure more, and ſo conclude at this time. You have had foure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; <hi>Expediency</hi> that is one meaſure, then <hi>decency,</hi> and <hi>conveniency,</hi> then <hi>commendableneſs,</hi> or <hi>laudableneſs,</hi> laſtly, <hi>Orderlineſſe.</hi>

So I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a word between a Miniſter and a Gentleman, the Miniſter diſputing with the Gentleman,<note place="margin">Of being covered, or uncovered in hearing.</note> whether he might put on his Hat in the Sermon time; the Miniſter holding ſtrongly that he ought not, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holding that he might, ſo when the Gentleman could not anſwer the Miniſter, ſaith he, Sir I will not diſpute with you: but I am very loath to doe that, by doing whereof I muſt of neceſſitie <hi>condemne</hi> the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the <hi>faithfull,</hi> I will not ſtand againſt your arguments: but I will not ſay, it is a ſin for a man to put on his Hat, becauſe I ſhould <hi>condemne</hi> the <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Saints, and godly people in <hi>England.</hi> Though we ſee no command, nor know nothing offenſive, yet let us beware how we doe that by our owne practiſe, that will <hi>condemne</hi> the Saints. So in this caſe, the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holds, that when a man is at <hi>Rome,</hi> let him doe as they doe at <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, in things that are not <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,</hi> when we have no other light, let us goe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:132715:76"/>to the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of the <hi>Churches.</hi> In ſome Churches they uſe not to put on their Hats, but to be bare in hearing the Word; while I am there I will even doe ſo; when I come there I will not put it on. God hath not <hi>determined</hi> it, and there it is the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of the Saints, here to be ſingular is naught. The Saints ſhould be ſingular from wicked people, and from good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in evill things, but in things that God hath not <hi>determined,</hi> we ſhould not be ſingular from them.</p>
                  <p>As to inſtance, in one caſe, in ſinging of <hi>Pſalmes</hi> among us, that troubles many of you.<note place="margin">Of ſinging Pſalmes.</note> We know that God hath commanded us to ſing <hi>Pſalmes, and Hymns, and ſpirituall Songs;</hi> we all agree in that, that is plain in the Word: But he ſhewes not there whether they ought to be <hi>ſongs</hi> of our owne compoſing, or the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of <hi>David;</hi> or in what <hi>tune</hi> wee ſhould ſing, in this, or that <hi>tune;</hi> or whether we ſhould ſing <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> or <hi>more,</hi> this is not <hi>determined.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I know not which is more <hi>expedient,</hi> that twenty, or forty <hi>ſing,</hi> or one alone. What ſhall I doe in this caſe? Look on the cuſtome of the Churches of God, that hath been practiſed by the Saints for time out of minde, and when God hath not <hi>determined</hi> it, and they have done ſo, therefore I will goe along with them, if it have been a generall cuſtome in the Church wee ought not raſhly to reject it. I tell you for my owne part, when I obſerve any <hi>cuſtome</hi> in any Church, any thing that is <hi>laudable,</hi> and <hi>comely,</hi> that God hath not <hi>determined,</hi> there is a kind of <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> that ſtriks my heart, though God doe not command it, or forbid it, yet being the <hi>cuſtome</hi> among the Saints, it works a <hi>reverence</hi> in my heart; therefore he rein make

                  <p>Thirdly, there is <hi>common reaſon,</hi>

                     <hi>right naturall reaſon</hi> in us, which many of the <hi>duties</hi> of the New-Teſtament are grounded on. If you ſay; what is that? It is a <hi>light</hi> in the ſoule, that is a <hi>Relique</hi> of that <hi>light</hi> that was in <hi>Adam.</hi> VVhen God made <hi>Adam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon what.</note> and all other creatures, he made all <hi>good,</hi> there were <hi>good</hi> things, and every thing in a good <hi>order;</hi> and he made <hi>Adam</hi> like himſelfe, <hi>God looked, and he ſaw everything that it was good:</hi> God put a <hi>light</hi> in him to <hi>judge</hi> of the <hi>Sun, Moone,</hi> and <hi>Stares; Adam</hi> had this light in a ſort, to judge of Heaven, and Earth, and hee ſaw that all was <hi>good.</hi> When <hi>Adam</hi> fell, he loſt a great deale of this <hi>light,</hi> and there came darkneſs, and confuſion; Yet the <hi>light</hi> is not growne ſo <hi>dimme,</hi> as the other <hi>faculties</hi> are grown <hi>looſe:</hi> for all carnall men (excepting none) they have <hi>light</hi> to judge beyond their <hi>power</hi> to <hi>practiſe,</hi> that is the reaſon the Heathen ſaid, I ſee <hi>good,</hi> and better things, but doe the <hi>worſt.</hi> So the carnalleſt man in the world hath ſome light to judge good, and evil, more than he hath ſtrength to doe; whence is this? It is a ſtamp of that <hi>light,</hi> that in <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>compleat</hi> at the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:132715:78"/>firſt. Now this right reaſon, it often helps the Saints when they have no other light; As in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. The Apoſtle reproves them for ſpeaking with <hi>ſtrange</hi> tongues in the Church, that the people underſtood not; what argument doth he uſe? ſaith he if an <hi>Ideot</hi> come in, and heare you babble together, will hee not ſay you are <hi>mad?</hi> that is, take a man that hath the leaſt ſpark of reaſon, of naturall light, and when hee ſees that you goe out of the order of the <hi>creation,</hi> hee will think you are beſide your ſelves. Take a ſimple man bring him to <hi>Smithfeild,</hi> &amp; let him ſee a goodly horſe, and though he never read in bookes to know the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a horſe, nor to heare him deſcribed, yet hee can ſay, this is a hanſome horſe; whence is this? hee hath the ſame ſparke of light, that was compleat in <hi>Adam.</hi> Take a woman that hath a painted face, and naked breaſts, and take another that goes handſomly, and attires her ſelf <hi>modeſtly,</hi> and put it to an <hi>Ideot,</hi> and let him judge which is the hanſomeſt, by the ſpark of right reaſon in him. Therefore in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. ſaith the Apſtole, <hi>if the woman be not covered, let her be ſhorne. Is it COMELY, judge yee?</hi> that is, in the eye of reaſon; we know by the light that we have from <hi>Adam,</hi> that it is an <hi>unſeemly</hi> thing. And ſo in many other caſes: but I can not ſtand upon them; this will help you out when nothing elſe will.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude all, you have had <hi>expediency,</hi> and <hi>decency,</hi> and <hi>commendablneſſe,</hi> and <hi>orderlineſſe,</hi> and now the <hi>example</hi> of the Saints, the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of the Churches, and <hi>right reaſon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The law of nature.</note> and now laſtly, the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> obſerve that; The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> what is that? There is in our nature that law that God once wrote in our hearts, and ſome reliques of that old edition; And
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:132715:78"/>that which we have by <hi>grace,</hi> is but a new edition, and many times in a new Print the old coppy doth help: ſo, many times we read the will of God by the old coppy; by the law of <hi>nature.</hi> This is the ground, there is no inſtitution, or command, unleſſe it be <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> that is contrary to the naturall command of God written in the <hi>heart;</hi> I ſay unleſſe it be <hi>extraordinary:</hi>

As for inſtance, in two lawes of nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.

And <hi>modeſty</hi> alſo is a law of nature; Therefore <hi>Sem,</hi>

As ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in <hi>baptiſme;</hi> that we conclude it to be an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, to uſe water to a holy end: But how wee ſhall <hi>baptize,</hi> whether by <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> or going into a <hi>River</hi> (becauſe it is probable ſome of them did) if we have no other light goe to the law of <hi>nature;</hi> for either men, and women muſt goe in naked, or clothed, if they goe naked, it is point blank againſt the law of <hi>modeſty,</hi> and ſo againſt the law of <hi>nature:</hi> and if they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:132715:79"/>goe in <hi>clothed</hi> if no houſe be neere, we know by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and reaſon that it is enough to <hi>murder</hi> many a man, ſo he ſhall deſtroy himſelf, therefore I conclude that God will not have me goe that way.</p>
                  <p>But if it be the will of God, notwithſtanding the inconveniency, we ſhould doe it.</p>
                  <p>I reaſon thus againſt you, we know by reaſon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that this may deſtroy a mans life, &amp; it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt;</hi> therefore I conclude it is not the will of God, it is not ſure, and ſafe to walk by it. Put theſe rules together, and you ſee in all caſes that God hath not determined, you have a ſure light to goe by. There are other motives, but I muſt leave them till the next time.</p>

                  <p>Beloved, to that briefely, I anſwer in generall, it is the way to <hi>peace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Motive 1. The right way to peace.</note> the right way. How? Thus, in all fallings out between man, and man in civill things; what is the way to <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>reconciliation?</hi> The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way is to divide ſtakes, to abate every one a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, every one to come to condeſcend each to other, that is the way to <hi>peace.</hi> We ſhould doe with our brethren, juſt as God doth with us, or wee with him, when we are fallen out; you know that <hi>ſin</hi> is <hi>enmity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; how comes there to be <hi>peace,</hi> &amp; <hi>reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> you know the way is, God comes, and meets us, and we are to meet him;<note place="margin">Every one to condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</note> as it is in <hi>Amos, Prepare to meet thy God O Iſrael.</hi> We meet the Lord, and hee meets us (as we ſee in the parable of the Prodigall and his father) and ſo there is <hi>peace,</hi> So there will never be peace among the Saints, as long as every one ſtands upon his points, and will not abate an ace: but he will goe his way, and doe what he liſt. The Apoſtles rule <hi>Rom.</hi> 12 is, brethren ſaith he, <hi>condeſcend to them of low degree:</hi> There is the way; <hi>Be of the ſame minde one with another:</hi> verſe 16.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:132715:80"/>every one <hi>abate</hi> a little, this is the way to <hi>peace.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. when there was diſſention about circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, it is notably worth your obſervation; when they were come to the Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Apoſtles were about the controverſie; they anſwer not punctually, they doe not blame the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or the <hi>Jewes;</hi> but they <hi>divide</hi> ſtakes, and deſire that the <hi>Jewes</hi> would not force <hi>circumſion</hi> upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and they deſire that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would not ſtand on things <hi>ſtrangled,</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> thoſe things of all others did give moſt offence to the <hi>Jewes:</hi> for it was notorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous for them to doe ſo; therefore they ſhould <hi>condeſcend</hi> to them ſo far, and the other ſhould <hi>conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend</hi> to them againe, and ſo there was like to be peace, and <hi>the Churches had joy;</hi> the honeſt humble hearted were glad. So, till people are willing to come down, and <hi>condeſcend</hi> to their brethren there will never be <hi>peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither doe not conceive that it is not poſſible in things ſpirituall, as well as civill; It is not impoſſible, there is a way in ſpirituall things alſo: The Lord hath promiſed <hi>one heart,</hi> and <hi>one way;</hi> it is not impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible for us to be as one man, to goe in one way.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:132715:81"/>ſuch a <hi>curious</hi> peice in every point. So I ſay, if thoſe that are called <hi>Presbyterians</hi> agree with themſelves, and their own <hi>principles,</hi> &amp; what they were ten yeares ſince, they agree with this Doctrine, and therefore there is no cauſe of offence to them.</p>

                  <p>But that I may ſatisfie you a little more, you will ſay; what, is there no more difference between <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> and <hi>Independents?</hi> I have heard that there is more <hi>difference</hi> between them, than between the <hi>Cavaleirs,</hi> and the other party; that they are ready to cut one anothers throats. If there be no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them; how comes this contention among them.</p>
                  <p>I think, of all the contentions that ever were among the Saints from Chriſts time till now, there was never ſuch a myſtery in any contention as there is in this.

                  <p>He may be,<note place="margin">Their principles</note> and be truly converted, I condemne not all, but it is very rare.

                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:132715:85"/>So <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> it is a good word, and a thing that God in Scripture commends: but by degrees carnall men they ſtole the name, <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and under that they perſecuted the Saints. So the Saints have the worſt end of the ſtaffe ſtill, the worſt names. As for theſe men, there is nothing to be done, but to diſcover them, and to pray for them that the Lord would open their eyes; I mean not any godly man, <hi>Independent,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> and therefore if thou be offended at this, thou ſheweſt thy ſelf to be a man that feareſt not God.</p>

                  <p>Then for the other ſide (though they care neither for <hi>Presbytery,</hi> nor <hi>Independency:</hi> but are down right <hi>Athieſts</hi>) they goe to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and they ſay that the <hi>Independents</hi> are <hi>deſtructive</hi> to the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> that they have ſtrange principles; that they will not fight in the warrs, becauſe they may not have their liberty, they leave all to us, and they will be at no loſſe; and if that party were rooted out, we ſhould

                  <p>Therefore, for the multitude (to conclude this uſe) labour to appeaſe the multitude, the multitude are ignorant, labour to inſtruct, and teach them. <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> and <hi>Independency</hi> are not two religions: but one religion to a godly, honeſt heart; it is only a little <hi>rufling</hi> of the <hi>fringe;</hi> therefore make not the breach wider, and blow not the fire more.

We opened this to you, and came to a Uſe, where we are at this time to exhort you, that this may ſinke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hearts, to wit, that you would not make lawes to your ſelves in the New-Teſtament, where Chriſt hath not bound you; and where Chriſt hath left you free, and hath not determined things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I exhorted you, that you would be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:132715:88"/>and vigilant, and wiſe, to take notice in all things what is expedient, and to doe the ſame; and to preſſe it on you, we propoſed one Motive to you, which was the maine drift of all the diſcourſe we intend upon this Scripture, to wit; that this is the ready way of <hi>peace,</hi> and to end ſtrife, and contention among the Saints. Now how that is, I have opened to you as I was able, and ſo finiſhed it this morning.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſet it on a little more upon your ſouls (not to repeate any thing) there are two or three words more that might ſtir you up. Conſider it, for I know it is a harſh truth to many of your eares, I feare you have many prejudices againſt it: but I beſeech you conſider it well, it is of great conſequence, it is one of the maſter ſtones in your foundation; I mean in your walking, and converſation, towards men at leaſt. I ſay, therefore I will add certaine motives more: and as the firſt was the way to <hi>peace</hi> among the <hi>Saints,</hi> to end <hi>controverſies</hi> that are among them;</p>

                  <p>As for inſtance, you make a law that you will pray twice before you goe forth every morning; private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in your <hi>familyes,</hi> and it is a good courſe if things be according, becauſe you are bound to <hi>pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes:</hi> but you make an abſolute law, and there comes another buſines of greater weight, you have prayed <hi>once,</hi> and you are going to the <hi>other,</hi> and it may be your neighbours houſe is on fire, or a poor man is in want; you goe, and you cannot chooſe, but then there is gall, and guilt upon your ſoules, becauſe you have neglected <hi>prayer.</hi> Whereas God hath not bound you to theſe things, but hath left you to doe this, or that according as it may be moſt for the <hi>honour</hi> of God, &amp; the everlaſting advantage of your own ſouls. Hence if you obſerve, and looke upon your own ſouls when you finde your ſelves in trouble, you ſhall ordinarily ſee the truth of this doctrine: Ask the queſtion, whence is this trouble? why are your ſoules ſo ſad? you ſhall finde ſix times for one that the trouble, and guilt ariſeth from theſe things, from making of <hi>lawes,</hi> and we are not able to keep them; whereas if wee would make an abſolute law of nothing, but what God hath made, and doe the reſt in <hi>expediency,</hi> we might be able to let goe that, and doe this that is <hi>expedient,</hi> wee ſhould doe abundance more good, and with <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>conſcience.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Chriſtians ful of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions why</note>And hence it is, that weak Chriſtians, (good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) are ſo full of queſtions, and caſes, and trouble themſelves, and Miniſters endleſſely. Why ſo? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many profeſſors walk only by rule, by law; this is their religion, they will avoide that which is evill, and doe that which is good: This is good, but this is not all; and ſeldome in my experience have I ſeen a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:132715:89"/>ſpirituall heart, that is ſpirituall indeed, much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with thoſe caſes of conſcience in outward things</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Spirituall Chriſtians their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</note>The reaſon is this, becauſe a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Chriſtian hath two eyes, the other hath but one: that is, when a ſpirituall Chriſtian falls on an action, he asks firſt, is it <hi>lawfull,</hi> or <hi>unlawfull?</hi> he eaſily reſolves that: but hee goes farther, is it convenient? doth it tend to the glory of God? will any be better for it? will my own ſoule be the better? is it decent? And it is ſix to one but he findes it <hi>expedient,</hi> and he conſiders the <hi>lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> no farther, that is gone, and an <hi>inexpedient</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a ſpirituall man it is as abominable as an action altogether <hi>unlawfull.</hi> Therefore we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely he ſpeaks of eating of fleſh, <hi>The earth is the Lords and the fulnes thereof;</hi> and make no <hi>conſcience</hi> of what is before you, yet he ſaith <hi>if eating of fleſh offend my brother;</hi> mark his high language, <hi>I will never eat fleſh while the world ſtandeth, rather than I will offend my brother;</hi> that is, I would ſoone anſwer the caſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, I will not trouble miniſters, or my ſelf about that. Weak Chriſtians not minding this, they ask only, is it <hi>lawfull?</hi> Is it <hi>lawfull</hi> to weare <hi>long</hi> haire? is it <hi>lawfull</hi> to <hi>play</hi> at <hi>tables?</hi> &amp;c. They goe no farther, and ſo there comes guilt upon their ſoules.</p>
                  <p>I heard once (I ſpeak it not with prejudice) of ſome godly women, that were godly perſons,<note place="margin">Baptiſme doubted of</note> they made great doubt of their <hi>baptiſme;</hi> and going by the rule that I told you before, making a curious peice in the New-Teſtament, and laying ſuch ſtreſſe upon every <hi>nick,</hi> that all was overthrown if that were wanting, they were baptized the <hi>firſt,</hi> and the <hi>ſecond,</hi> and the <hi>third</hi> time, and ſtill they feared there was a fault, that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:132715:90"/>they could not ſleep in their beds, for horrour of conſcience leaſt there ſhould be a <hi>nick,</hi> or flaw in the <hi>leaſt,</hi> in their <hi>baptiſme,</hi> and ſo were ſtill ſtudying a way to doe it better. So it will be in all caſes when men make lawes where God hath not made them, there will trouble and guilt follow, in that they are not able to performe them.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak it not to weaken, or innervate any of the people of God, in abſolute commands: but where God hath left a latitude (as I have proved) let us take notice of it, and order all things for the glory of God, and the <hi>edification</hi> of our ſelves, and others. And that is another motive.</p>
                  <p>Briefly,<note place="margin">Mot. 3. He that eyes not expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy cannot doe much for God.</note> the third is this, to perſwade you to this (for I feare many doe not underſtand this, and you are hardly brought to it, becauſe your hearts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the real principles of the Goſpel, whereof this is one) as it is the way to end controverſies among the brethren; and the way to keep peace within our ſelves. So thirdly, unleſſe you will receive this truth, and labour to underſtand it, if you goe by the other way, taking every thing <hi>jure divino,</hi> to be an abſolute rule to binde people in all the world, and then when you have put ſtreſſe on them, and broken them, you conclude there is <hi>no</hi> Church, nor <hi>no</hi> believers: ſuch a ſoule will never be able to do much for God, he will never be able to honour God much; he may pleaſe himſelfe, as ſuch doe, and think that he is growen in <hi>grace,</hi> and hath out-ſtripped others and he may trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Kingdome, and rend the Churches, and make <hi>debate</hi> among the Saints: but take this for certaine, he ſhall never be able to honour God much, he ſhall doe little in his <hi>generation.</hi> I mean (that I may come to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:132715:90"/>particulars) he will neither be able to do much in <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>ſinners,</hi> nor in <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> of weak <hi>Saints:</hi> for in thoſe two wayes are the greateſt opportunities we have of honouring God; <hi>If yee love me feed my lambes,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. He cannot doe it; why ſo?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. They preſent religion to others as endleſſe.</note>Firſt, becauſe ſuch a man, or ſuch a people that are ſet in ſuch a way (as many are in theſe dayes, and many godly people) they preſent <hi>Religion</hi> to others alwayes as an <hi>endleſſe</hi> thing, as a thing that hath no <hi>end.</hi> And therefore when they perſwade <hi>weak</hi> Chriſtians to be religious, they look upon their <hi>religion</hi> as a <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit;</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The lips of a whore is a deep pit.</hi> They think here is a religion <hi>indeed,</hi> if we cloſe with this people we ſhall not know where to ſtay; the laſt <hi>moneth</hi> they were in one religion, and the laſt yeare in another; and ſo they ſeek a <hi>knot</hi> in a <hi>bulruſh,</hi> they ſeek for <hi>curioſity</hi> where God hath not laid it, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ever <hi>wandering.</hi> They perſwade us to be of this <hi>Church,</hi> and of this <hi>religion,</hi> and we ſhall be ſafe, ſay carnall men; how earneſt are they to have us be with <hi>them,</hi> and two moneths agoe they were as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for another, and it may be two moneths hence they will be for <hi>another;</hi> and ſo they run from them. Therefore in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. when there was a great deale of ſtir among the Chriſtians, about <hi>Genealogies,</hi> and <hi>old wives tales,</hi> and vaine ſtories; <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy take heed</hi> of them. Why? becauſe they were <hi>endleſſe,</hi> that is, if a man goe to them, they goe from one fancy to another, he knows not where to finde them. When <hi>Paul</hi> would cleare himſelf from an ill report they had of him among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. he takes this for one argument, <hi>our converſation was in ſimplicitia,</hi> we walked in the <hi>light of the Sun</hi> before you, and hee
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:132715:91"/>comes with another argument, <hi>our yea was yea, and our nay was nay;</hi> He brings this as an argument to regaine their thoughts for religion: for it was not for his own honour ſake that he carried himſelfe ſtayedly among the Saints (which is lovely:) for weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans look on ſuch men, and on religion as a weak <hi>ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> looks on the ſtreame of waters, ſaith he, I will goe in the <hi>ſhallow,</hi> for if I goe in the <hi>ſtreame,</hi> I ſhall not know where to ſtay, I ſhall be carried down to the Sea. So, though men may think that this is growth in <hi>grace,</hi> to grow from one <hi>fancy</hi> to another in <hi>externall</hi> things. As one that asked a woman, why ſhe was not baptized againe? ſaith he, <hi>you grow not in grace,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay; there is no growing in grace without theſe <hi>outward</hi> things. As I remember (without diſparaging the perſon, he is unknown to you) a man that was a member of a Church; and becauſe he ſaw <hi>infants</hi> baptized, and himſelf was not, he broke off from them and ſaid there was no <hi>Church,</hi> and all the ſtreame did run for two moneths together on <hi>baptiſme,</hi> there was nothing talked of but that, and concluded, the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> and all were <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and there was no Church, nor any thing till we had <hi>Apoſtles</hi> againe; as I told you, that any that hold that principle and follow it cloſely, and <hi>rationally,</hi> they will infalliably come to <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Signes</hi> from heaven. And reaſon ſhewes it; for they will frame ſuch a <hi>curious</hi> peice, like <hi>Moſes,</hi> that ſhall be an abſolute rule to binde every thing, and nothing ſhall be <hi>expedient,</hi> or <hi>inexpedient:</hi> but all <hi>cammanded,</hi> or <hi>forbidden,</hi> nuzzel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſearching for this peice and cannot finde it; they will give over, and ſay, let us have Apoſtles, &amp;c. And ſo how ſhall they <hi>win</hi> poore <hi>ſinners,</hi> when they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:132715:91"/>ſee they whirle about? will they ever delight in your <hi>religion,</hi> when it is thus preſented to them? <hi>Carnall</hi> people, though they cannot anſwer their objections, yet they will ſay, theſe people we know not where they ſtand, therefore we will not meddle with them: Such people as ſtudie <hi>crotchets</hi> and put ſuch ſtreſſe on them, they can doe little good; whereas if they would walk by <hi>expediency,</hi> they would win people to the Lord. Therefore, ſuffer not thy heart to be above the word of God to maſter it, but put thy heart under the word of God, and let it ſquare thee, try thy heart by the word of God; or elſe I know who will have the worſt of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. They preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</note>Another reaſon is, as they preſent religion as an <hi>endleſſe</hi> thing; So as a wondrous <hi>burthenſome</hi> thing, as an intollerable <hi>task</hi> to them. And our nature, fleſh and blood is ſo averſe to goodneſs, that it is loath to under goe even the <hi>ſweet</hi> yoke of Chriſt. In the ſecond <hi>Pſalme</hi> there is a propheſie of the people under Chriſt, <hi>Let us break their bands</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and caſt away their cords from us.</hi> VVhich is only meant of the <hi>law</hi> of Jeſus <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is an <hi>eaſie</hi> yoke, and a <hi>light</hi> burthen; now when people ſhall goe, and add abundance to this, and make as many more lawes, and more grievous than Chriſt hath made, and ſhall preſent ſuch a maſſe to the people, no wonder that they ſtart off and run from them: For preſent Chriſt as <hi>lovely,</hi> and <hi>amiable</hi> as you can, yet a carnall heart accounts it a <hi>burthen,</hi> and runs away. That is the reaſon (to my knowledge) that in ſome countries people have laboured much, &amp; done little good; VVhy? this was the greateſt ſtumbling block, they made lawes concerning <hi>haire;</hi> it muſt be of ſuch a <hi>collour,</hi> the <hi>ſcarfe,</hi> and the <hi>band,</hi> and the <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercheife</hi>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:132715:92"/>upon it, &amp; ſo caſt dams upon people; they law ſuch lawes that they would not come neare them, but <hi>railed</hi> againſt godlines, and ſome were readie to <hi>hang,</hi> &amp; <hi>drowne</hi> themſelves, and from thence it comes, they make <hi>nicks</hi> &amp; <hi>knacks</hi> where the <hi>ſcripture</hi> makes none. So that though all men do not ſo, yet generally carnal men conceive ſome ſuch thing. I remember a ſtory of a <hi>learned</hi> man, that there being a <hi>wild</hi> Gentleman of a great eſtate, ſet to him to traine him up, and bring him under a little: the young man hated and abhorred him, and had as leiv be hanged as come neere him: for he thought he ſhould <hi>looſe</hi> all his <hi>liberty:</hi> but the old <hi>Gentleman</hi> would <hi>walk,</hi> and the young man with him, and when the young man would <hi>bowle,</hi> he would <hi>bowle</hi> with him; and when he ſaw it was not ſuch a task, as he thought it had been, he proved a <hi>godly</hi> zealous man; So this is a mighty hinderance of doing good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to make religion to ſeeme gaſtly, by little <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,</hi> and <hi>knacks</hi> that men make that Chriſt hath not bound them to; a carnall heart will not come into ſuch a priſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3. They preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as rediculous.</note>Thirdly, they can doe little good to others, becauſe they preſent religion to carnall men as a <hi>ridiculous</hi> thing to be <hi>laughed</hi> at. How ſo? I will tell you, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men however you conceive of them, they have oft a ſpirit of <hi>illumination,</hi> common <hi>knowledge,</hi> and right <hi>reaſon:</hi> and by <hi>common</hi> knowledge, and <hi>right</hi> reaſon, they may be able to judge farther than many Chriſtians, what is the <hi>will</hi> of God, and what is not, in <hi>externall</hi> things, though they be ſtrangers from the <hi>power</hi> of thoſe things. Therefore when you come to carnall men, and ſcatter ſuch lawes, and commands, and rules among them, though they be ſtrangers from the <hi>power,</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:132715:92"/>yet they are able to judge as well as your ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be the <hi>lawes</hi> of God or no: for they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and reaſon, they have <hi>Scripture,</hi> and they have common <hi>illumination:</hi> therefore when people make ſuch lawes, (whereas they ſhould reſpect what is <hi>expedient,</hi> and take the lawes that Chriſt hath made) they expoſe themſelves to be laughed at, they are ſo far from gaining of ſoules.</p>
                  <p>But Fourthly, (becauſe this is a great thing) for that reaſon we came into the world to win ſoules,<note place="margin">4. By not eyeing what is expedient men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of doing good.</note> and to feed the lambes of Chriſt; therefore I ſhall ſhew you farther that by ſo doing you <hi>deprive</hi> your ſelves of abundance of <hi>opportunities</hi> to do good, that though they would never ſo faine do good as much as others, yet they are deprived of the <hi>opportunity</hi> to <hi>doe,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> good. My meaning is not, that any ſhould doe <hi>evil that good may come of it:</hi> neither doe I mean that men ſhould doe lawfull things, if they be in a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition: but my meaning is, they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to remoove all <hi>prejudices,</hi> and <hi>miſconceits</hi> of things, whereby they lay blocks in their own way. As for inſtance, how many godly men in this land, <hi>godly,</hi> and holy, and of great <hi>gifts,</hi> &amp; that deſire to doe good, and it may be out of a <hi>conceit,</hi> or rather (with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) out of <hi>conſcience</hi> of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> or the <hi>places</hi> we preach in, have hid their tallents, and have laid downe their work, and kept in their <hi>gifts,</hi> and become <hi>unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</hi> And how many hundred Chriſtians are there that are <hi>godly,</hi> and holy <hi>people</hi> out of conſcience of the <hi>calling</hi> of the Miniſters, or the houſe that they meet in, have with the griefe of their ſoules, and many a heavy heart, <hi>ſhut</hi> themſelves in a <hi>hole,</hi> foure or five women together, and loſt the uſe of thoſe bleſſed <hi>gifts.</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:132715:93"/>If they had ſtudied whether it had been <hi>convenient,</hi> it had been worth the while to diſpute: but God hath made no law for preaching in a <hi>pulpit,</hi> or in a <hi>pew,</hi> or in a houſe of <hi>ſtone,</hi> or not of <hi>ſtone:</hi> but making an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute law that it muſt hold in all caſes, they fall into theſe ſnares that are greivous.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not this that you ſhould <hi>perſecute</hi> ſuch, for they are <hi>godly</hi> people, and it is a ſigne they have <hi>tender</hi> conſciences. I mean not ſo; nor doe I perſwade them to do things without ſome <hi>knowledg,</hi> that they ſhould not doe it doubtingly: but I deſire you to receive this truth, whereby the occaſion of ſuch ſcruples may be remooved. There be foure things;</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing is this, that clearly demonſtrates that they cannot doe much for God,<note place="margin">5. If they do good it is by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> or the honour of God: becauſe if they doe any thing for God, for the <hi>winning</hi> of others, it is, as I may ſay, by <hi>chance,</hi> by <hi>accident:</hi> for it is a thing beſide their <hi>intention.</hi> This is their religion; it is not to ſtudie how I may <hi>honour</hi> God, and <hi>bring</hi> in ſinners: this ſcarſly comes in their thoughts, but what is truth, and what is falſe, what is <hi>lawfull,</hi> and what is <hi>unlawfull.</hi> Therefore divers that elſe are godly men, let them have a <hi>nick</hi> right, or wrong they never conſider the Congregation, how they may doe moſt good: but they think this is <hi>truth,</hi> and every <hi>truth</hi> muſt be <hi>preached</hi> in <hi>every</hi> place, at <hi>every</hi> time, to <hi>every</hi> people, this is their religion; they never look if it may doe good. Wheras a Chriſtian that makes no more lawes than Chriſt hath made, and ſtudies what is <hi>expedient,</hi> and would win ſouls, hee muſt be wiſe, and watchfull, and <hi>circumſpect,</hi> and able to ſee what may conduce to <hi>edification.</hi> Therefore men in Scripture that were ſent to win ſoules; they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:132715:93"/>
                     <hi>fiſher-men;</hi> the Apoſtles were: and fiſher-men muſt be <hi>cunning,</hi> it is not every <hi>baite,</hi> that will catch <hi>every</hi> fiſh, he muſt baite and <hi>waite,</hi> and be <hi>cunning,</hi> and <hi>wiſe.</hi> Saith <hi>Paul, I took you by guile;</hi> I had a way to win you, and inſinuate into you: men muſt make it their ſtudie if they will win ſouls to the Lord, to look not only that they preach <hi>truth,</hi> but what truth, to <hi>what</hi> people, and what <hi>way</hi> they doe it. Therefore <hi>Paul Gal.</hi> 2. when hee came among people that were not able to receive the truth concerning <hi>juſtification,</hi> and concerning <hi>ceremonies,</hi> he preached to them of <hi>good repute;</hi> that is, <hi>choice</hi> Chriſtians that were able to beare it, that they might communicate it to others, or elſe he ſhould looſe his labour, and <hi>run in vaine.</hi> So in <hi>Act.</hi> 19. where there was great ſtrife about the Temple of <hi>Diana, Paul</hi> when he came there, he knew that the peoples hearts were ſet on their <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>worſhiping</hi> of their <hi>Idol,</hi> therefore he doth wiſely to doe their ſouls good, he might have ſaid, I preach the <hi>truth;</hi> and down with the <hi>image</hi> of <hi>Diana;</hi> but when the buſines was done, beſpake not a word againſt <hi>Diana,</hi> and the <hi>Temple;</hi> he hated the <hi>image,</hi> and the <hi>Temple:</hi> but he went the wiſeſt way to work to win them. That is another reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">6. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend good only to few.</note>A ſixt reaſon is this, theſe people cannot doe good for the winning of others, and for the feeding of the poore lambes of Chriſt; why ſo? If they doe any I told you it is by <hi>accident,</hi> it is beſide their intention, or if they intend any, it is a few of their owne minde and <hi>judgement,</hi> thoſe that are in <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with them only, and the reſt they look on them as <hi>unbelievers,</hi> though they be never ſo holy, and the Spirit of God have ſealed to their ſoules; yet they are <hi>unbelievers,</hi>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:132715:94"/>and are in an <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> eſtate, and have the <hi>mark</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> on them, and goe from them as if they had the <hi>plague</hi> on them. I ſay, thou mayeſt doe good to thoſe people that are of thy <hi>owne</hi> minde: thou canſt never doe good to others with ſuch language under ſuch notions; whereas others that walk according to the truth that I teach, they walk <hi>equally</hi> to all Saints, and as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I became all things to all men, that I might win ſome.</hi> He labours to win ſinners, to nouriſh the weak, if they have any thing of Chriſt hee loves them, &amp; if they have nothing he endeavours to work it. VVhereas the other looks on them as <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> and can doe them no good.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, though wee looke ſo on them wee would doe them good if they would hearken to us.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſo, and it is probable you would do them good: but I tell you you ſhall never be able to doe it in that way; VVhy? becauſe as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth:</hi> If you love them not you can not edifie them. If I did know a man that ſhould teach mee, and <hi>loved</hi> me nor, I <hi>cannot,</hi> I will <hi>not</hi> be <hi>edified.</hi> VVhen good people that are ſealed that they are the Lords, and that Chriſt is in them; when people ſhall come and call them <hi>Antichriſtians,</hi> and that they have the <hi>mark of the Beaſt</hi> on them, and that they are <hi>unbelievers;</hi> are they like to doe them good? they are not, becauſe love doth not intervene.</p>

                     <note place="margin">7. They lead others to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note>Shall I add one word more, and end that? Laſtly, they cannot win others, or doe good to others; why ſo? (It is a foreword, I am death to ſpeak it, but I know it is true) becauſe they are ſo far from <hi>edifying,</hi> that thoſe that goe that way, according to that <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:132715:94"/>they <hi>lead</hi> many ſilly <hi>ſouls</hi> to their own <hi>deſtruction;</hi> How? I will demonſtrate it thus, the principle is this, that nick that is new, they lay ſuch <hi>ſtreſſe</hi> on it, that he that followes that is a <hi>believer,</hi> and a <hi>Saint,</hi> though he be ſtark naught; now there is no poor <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> man, there is no ſoule ſo <hi>wicked,</hi> and <hi>wretched</hi> but hee would be willing to doe ſomething for himſelfe, and when he findes ſo eaſie a way to Heaven, that it is but <hi>obſerving</hi> ſuch an <hi>externall</hi> thing, he will be of that way, though he be a <hi>whoremonger,</hi> an <hi>adulterer.</hi> As it is in Popery (though I compare not the perſons, but there is the ſame principle in both) how comes their Church to be ſo great? they come to poore people that know not what to doe for ſalvation, and they ſay, come, be of our Church and you ſhall be ſaved; take ſuch a <hi>Religion</hi> on you, <hi>confeſſe</hi> your ſins to the Preiſt, and doe this, and that, and then you ſhail be ſaved. It is the ſame principle; you place ſalvation, and <hi>heaven</hi> in <hi>externall</hi> things, and moſt of your owne making, and then poore ſoules that would goe to heaven, and goe the neareſt way they could finde, they come, and they will obſerve thoſe <hi>externall</hi> things: and then what is the end of it? After all this adoe there will be a <hi>carnall</hi> prophane <hi>heart,</hi> that was never changed, that Chriſt was never in. I have ſeen more than one that have been asked; what evidence have you that Chriſt is in you? I have walked in <hi>ſuch</hi> a way this twenty, or two and twenty yeares, or ſo long, and I am come out from <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> A man may doe ſo, and be a <hi>damned</hi> creature when all is done; I have ſeen ſome (though I think there be ſcarſe any Chriſtians in the world beſides that have done it) that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a world of <hi>tricks,</hi> and <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Therefore poore carnall ſouls are gulled when ſuch tricks are put on them; carnall hearts <hi>run</hi> there, and think to be <hi>ſafe,</hi> and crow over others: &amp; in the end they prove <hi>carnal.</hi> This is not the way to win others, or do good to others. So you have three motives.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Motive that ſhould move you to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to this truth,<note place="margin">Mot. 4. Without looking to expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy a man cannot be an excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lent Chriſtian.</note> to labour to underſtand it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and to walk by it, for otherwiſe you will never be <hi>excellent</hi> Chriſtians; remember that word: <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, excellent</hi> Chriſtians never make ſuch tricks: you ſhall alway obſerve that the <hi>Eagle</hi> lookes not after flies; I have never ſeen, and I have conſidered with my ſelf, I have ſcarſly ever, if ever ſeen a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Chriſtian goe that way; you ſhall obſerve in your ſelves (if I be not deceived) that when your ſoules are in a ſpirituall temper, full of the <hi>love</hi> of God, and <hi>communion</hi> with Chriſt, and in a holy ſpirituall frame, you ſhall not finde ſuch a diſpoſition in you to make ſuch a <hi>glorious</hi> buſineſs of little <hi>externall</hi> things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that God hath <hi>commanded,</hi> though wee muſt not neglect that, much leſſe thoſe that God never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: So the <hi>excellency</hi> in Chriſtianity, or the beauty of holineſs. I would ſet it out (as a godly man in another caſe,) by the naturall beauty of a man or a woman; VVhat makes a man or a woman <hi>beautifull.</hi> It is not onely the having of ſo many <hi>limbes;</hi> another man may have as many <hi>leggs,</hi> and <hi>fingers,</hi> and <hi>toes</hi> as a beautifull man hath, and yet not be <hi>beautifull;</hi> but what is the <hi>beauty</hi> of a man? a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:132715:95"/>
                     <hi>ſumety,</hi> or <hi>harmony</hi> and <hi>proportion,</hi> between the humours of the bodie with in, and the <hi>members</hi> without; as a man is not beautiful that hath a <hi>great</hi> head, and a little <hi>hand,</hi> that is no proportion; So a Chriſtian that walks by the rule of <hi>lawfulneſſe,</hi> and <hi>unlawfulneſſe</hi> only, by what is <hi>lawfull,</hi> and <hi>commanded,</hi> and what is <hi>forbidden,</hi> hee will not be a <hi>beautiful</hi> Chriſtian, that is but a limbe of Chriſtianity: but <hi>excellent</hi> Chriſtianity ariſeth from <hi>proportion</hi> between our actions, when an action is not only good, but it is done <hi>expediently,</hi> it is done <hi>decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and <hi>orderly;</hi> As a <hi>Lute,</hi> or a paire of <hi>Virginals</hi> that have as many ſtrings as they need, yet there may be no muſicke: So there is no beautie in a Chriſtian that ſaith, what is <hi>truth,</hi> and what is <hi>falſhood,</hi> and what is <hi>lawful,</hi> and what <hi>unlawful;</hi> But the <hi>beauty</hi> is when a man ordereth his wayes, as that he doth things for the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of God, and for the <hi>good</hi> of others, and of his own ſoule: this makes an <hi>excellent</hi> Chriſtian, the other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>excellent</hi> Chriſtians.

That a man may ſay, and ſay truly, that there are divers people that trade in <hi>externall</hi> things; as <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh, the people are idle;</hi> So it is a hundred to one but thou haſt an <hi>idle</hi> ſoule within, that is left at randome, thou knoweſt not what termes God and thy ſoule are in; And therefore you ſhall finde in ſeverall places in <hi>Timothy,</hi> there was a ſtir about <hi>Genealogies,</hi> they might have ſaid it is <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>truth.

                     <note place="margin">3.

Bring a ſpirituall Saint, and tell him, here is a Church and <hi>Congregation,</hi> there is none like it in the world, they are all <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> but this: bring him there, and there all their <hi>prayers,</hi> and their <hi>diſcourſes,</hi> and <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> it is onely of <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> and I know not what, and they are endleſſe upon that, and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Babylon,</hi> and this is <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Sion;</hi> a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſoule cannot feed on this, he cannot live there, no more than a fiſh on the ſhore. As <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, as the <hi>mouth</hi> judges of <hi>taſtes,</hi> ſo doth the <hi>eare</hi> of <hi>words.</hi> Wee can give no <hi>reaſon</hi> of our <hi>taſting,</hi> why a thing is <hi>ſweet,</hi> or <hi>ſoure,</hi> and ſo of <hi>hearing:</hi> but there is a ſecret thing within, that cannot ſavour thoſe <hi>external</hi> things, and husks that feed not the ſoul; and a Saint being a ſheep of Chriſt he knowes his <hi>voyce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another reaſon is this, that an excellent Saint hee hath ſuch a good <hi>ſtock,</hi> or <hi>eſtate</hi> within, that he cannot
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:132715:97"/>but contemplate his enjoying of God,<note place="margin">He hath ſtock enough within.</note> as much as may be, he <hi>needs</hi> not go abroad ſo far to thoſe things.

                     <note place="margin">The courſe of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders.</note> or <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders,</hi> they have crakt eſtates; for when men <hi>backſlid</hi> from God, and have loſt their <hi>communion</hi> with Chriſt; what then? they will make it up in <hi>outward</hi> things to the utmoſt, even to ſuperarogation. As in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> when the people had <hi>backſlided,</hi> and <hi>revolted,</hi> they brought abundance of <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> God was weary of them; he complaines not of the want of them: but he ſaith, I will have none of them, away with them; the <hi>kernell</hi> of the ſoule is gone. So in <hi>Micah</hi> 6. thoſe wicked people that did enjoy nothing of God in their ſoules, ſay they; <hi>How ſhall I come before the Lord? ſhall I bring a thouſand rams, or ten thouſand rivers of oyle? ſhal I give the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoule?</hi> O no; the Lord will none of them. So, when ſoules are broken, and <hi>banckrupt,</hi> generally thoſe people for a while keep up a <hi>profeſsion</hi> in <hi>externall</hi> knacks. Therefore back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders that run from God, and are aſhamed to be prophane, for a yeare or two, they take up an <hi>external</hi> Religion, and make endleſſe <hi>knacks,</hi> and will be brave people, and by and by down goes that too. Uſually when the devill drawes people from God, hee eates the <hi>kernell</hi> a yeare, or two before, and then he knows they will throw away the <hi>ſhell.</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly, (to conclude at this time) this ſhould move you to conſider,<note place="margin">Mot. 6. It will offend God to make laws where hee hath not or abuſed liberty.</note> how much the <hi>Lord</hi> will be <hi>offended</hi> with you, and that juſtly, in caſe when you come to judgment you be found to have either <hi>bound</hi> your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves where God hath made you free, or have uſed your <hi>liberty</hi> to his <hi>diſhonour;</hi> for both theſe I drive at. God hath given us <hi>liberty</hi> in the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> a <hi>great</hi> deale of liberty; he hath given us that honour as <hi>ſonnes,</hi> hee hath not bound us with little lawes, as in the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> he did them as little children. Now if we uſe this <hi>liberty</hi> to his <hi>diſhonour,</hi> and not ſeek in every thing to advantage our own <hi>ſoules,</hi> and to further his <hi>glory,</hi> there will be a fearfull reckoning.</p>
                  <p>Let mee tell you a word, that may ſeeme ſtrange to ſome of you; That the Lord may be more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a Chriſtian for doing an <hi>inexpedient</hi> thing, or for not doing an <hi>expedient thing,</hi> than for forgoing a thing abſolutely <hi>commanded;</hi> As thus, God oft gives us an abſolute <hi>command,</hi> and he ſends another dutie in that makes him ſuſpend with the former (as I have ſhewed) as a leſſe duty is no duty when a <hi>greater</hi> comes in place: but when it is <hi>expedient</hi> compleatly, God never <hi>diſpenſeth</hi> with ſuch an action, but it is a ſin not to doe it. As for inſtance, ſuppoſe you have a <hi>ſonne</hi> that is at age; and you have an <hi>Apprentiſe</hi> and you bid him doe ſo much <hi>work,</hi> &amp; you go home to your houſe, and bid your ſonne ſtudie to doe that that may be for the honour of his father, but you tie him to nothing. And when you are from home the ſonne meets with
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:132715:99"/>an <hi>opportunitie</hi> that might have inriched his fathers houſe for ever, if he had taken it, but he did it not, and the ſervant is <hi>negligent,</hi> and doth not doe his work in your abſence; When the father comes home, and the ſonne ſhall ſay, I had an advantage to have <hi>advanced</hi> you, and us all, but I did not take it, his father did not command him to lay hold of the opportunitie; but judge you, would you be more <hi>angrie</hi> with the ſonne, or with the ſervant, that neglected only a few trifling things. So you have opportunitie to make God <hi>hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable</hi> (as I may with reverence ſpeak) in ſuch a <hi>Court,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Committee,</hi> at ſuch a <hi>time,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>thing</hi> that God hath not abſolutely <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded,</hi> or <hi>forbidden.</hi> This is the reaſon if you compare <hi>Jude</hi> with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> why there are ſuch <hi>woes</hi> threatned againſt thoſe <hi>that turn the grace of God into wantones, they bring upon themſelves ſwift dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Why ſo? God beſtoweth <hi>grace</hi> and hath made them <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>redeemed</hi> them, and they turne all to <hi>wantoneſſe,</hi> and <hi>looſneſſe.</hi> Therefore I will conclude only with one inſtance, and that is thus, ſuppoſe you had a ſervant in your houſe, the maſter workman of the ſhop, that you doe not uſe to tie to any thing, he is a good ſervant, and hath wiſdome to do himſelf good, and to advance the familie, &amp; you have a little young <hi>Apprentiſe,</hi> and you tie him to doe ſo much work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you come home; and both neglect it, the great man, and the boy, they have done nothing; What will you ſay? You will ſay to the man, I thought you had had more <hi>wiſdome,</hi> I thought you would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven good <hi>example</hi> to the childe, that you had been a man of <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and would have been truſtie when I was gone from home, and for <hi>you</hi> to be idle, and to let goe ſuch a <hi>market,</hi> and ſuch <hi>cuſtomers;</hi> you would be a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:132715:100"/>hundred fold more angrie with him than with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus the <hi>Jewes</hi> were children, and were tied to an ilet-hole, and to the ſnuffe of a candle. Now the Lord hath left <hi>us free</hi> for his <hi>honour,</hi> and our advantage. Now, when we ſhall come to reckon before the Lord, and God ſhall finde carnall <hi>profeſſors</hi> that never laid hold of an opportunity to <hi>honour</hi> God; what will God ſay? I thought you would have <hi>honoured</hi> me, you have another <hi>Goſpel</hi> for <hi>clearneſſe,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> and you have more <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and the offer of my <hi>Spirit,</hi> and yet you were <hi>drunken,</hi> and <hi>carnall</hi> profeſſors, you had ſo many opportunities, and you let them goe, and did me no <hi>honour;</hi> but lived as <hi>droanes,</hi> and did goe out as the <hi>ſnufe</hi> of a candle; I will pay you for all. The ſumme is, not to <hi>neglect</hi> any known <hi>commandment,</hi> but to make <hi>no</hi> more than God hath <hi>made,</hi> and to make out the reſt in <hi>expediencie;</hi> that is the way to honour the Lord. Therefore to conclude, I wiſh, and exhort you, as <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>So ſpeak, and ſo do, as thoſe that ſhall be jugded by the law of liberty.</hi> O, the law of <hi>liberty</hi> will be a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere</hi> law one day. God hath called us to be <hi>ſonnes,</hi> he hath given us a great deale of <hi>liberty,</hi> whereby we may ſerve him more to his <hi>glory,</hi> and with more <hi>honour</hi> to our ſelves, if we abuſe this, and walk <hi>carnally,</hi> and <hi>ill-favouredly,</hi> it will be a <hi>ſevere law</hi> to us, and a <hi>ſevere day</hi> to ſuch profeſſors.</p>

Now for the removing of this, conſider, and underſtand theſe three things, that ſo I may proceed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that whereas we have ſpent foure, or five <hi>Lords dayes</hi> in opening this doctrine to you, ayming at peace among the Saints: (for, for the other the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the <hi>Serpent</hi> they will never be reconciled) I would have you underſtand this, that I have not all this while pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and directly ſpoken againſt any mans <hi>way</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. It is true, I have had occaſion to ſpeak of thoſe that you call <hi>Familiſts,</hi> and <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (though I be wary to uſe any of theſe words, becauſe I deſire peace, but in all that I have ſaid hetherto of any of theſe mens wayes, I did not properly ſpeak againſt any of their wayes; but what I ſpake was by way of illuſtration,<note place="margin">The ſcope of the whole work.</note> only to illuſtrate, and cleare the thing in hand; what is that? This, that I profeſſe my ſelfe an open adverſarie, and enemie to, of any thing in the world; all my drift hath been to illuſtrate, and cleare out, that <hi>Old-Teſtament principle,</hi> that is the root of all miſcheife almoſt.

                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:132715:101"/>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of people among you;<note place="margin">2. Sorts of people.</note> which doe ſomewhat diſcourage, and hinder us in the work.</p>
                  <p>The one is, divers that are wonderous well <hi>pleaſed,</hi> I will not ſay, but ſome are <hi>pleaſed</hi> to <hi>edification;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Some that are pleaſed with the doctrine for faction</note> they are pleaſed becauſe they be edified; I hope ſo. But I feare others are exceedingly taken: becauſe I have occaſion to mention all theſe ſorts of people, therefore they are pleaſed, becauſe every one hopes to get the other to his <hi>faction.</hi> As if he be a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> it is nutts to him to heare any thing ſpoken againſt the <hi>Independents;</hi> and if he be an <hi>Independent,</hi> to heare the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt: ſo I feare you are pleaſed, becauſe you are in faction; and every one is glad to have the Preacher ſide with his faction. This pleaſeth corruption, but doth the ſoule no good.</p>
                  <p>Others, on the other ſide are offended exceedingly at what hath been ſaid, why ſo?<note place="margin">2. Some offended becauſe their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</note> becauſe hearing any thing ſpoken of that patty they are of (whatſoever it is, by way of illuſtration, to cleare, and follow, and hunt out this principle, they take it hainouſly; why ſo? becauſe religion (I muſt tell you) is all in <hi>faction,</hi> among us; therefore though you your ſelves acknowledge that there are ſome godly men that are <hi>Independents,</hi> and ſome godly men that are <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> yet it is ſo in <hi>faction,</hi> that if a Preacher <hi>raile</hi> againſt <hi>Presbytery</hi> he is an <hi>excellent</hi> Preacher, and on the other ſide, if he be bitter againſt <hi>Independents</hi> he is a rare man, and ſo you goe along in faction, that no man living is able to doe your ſoules good.</p>
                  <p>I bewaile it, and it will be your miſery; you in this City, of all places in Chriſtendome, (excepting none) are miſerable people. Here is a populous place, and abundance of Preachers, and abundance of <hi>itching eares,</hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:132715:102"/>and <hi>greaſie</hi> hearts as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, and you will not be tyed by the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to your Pariſhes, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not that, but you will not be tied by the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to <hi>ſuffer the word of exhortation,</hi> but you make a trade of <hi>wandering</hi> from <hi>Miniſter</hi> to <hi>Miniſter</hi> to try their eares, and as ſoone as you have heard a word that croſſeth your <hi>corruption,</hi> and your <hi>fancy</hi> you are gone. As if a poore ſoldier ſhould come with a wounded <hi>arme,</hi> or a broken <hi>legg,</hi> and deſire a Chirurgeon to put on a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and when hee feeles it ſmart, away he goes from that <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> to another, and ſo to a <hi>third,</hi> &amp;. a <hi>fourth.</hi> So, you are miſerable ſouls, without Gods mercy like to periſh for ever; you have hearts as fat as <hi>brawne,</hi> as fat as <hi>greaſe,</hi> as ſome tranſlate it. VVhat is that? Our work is upon your hearts, we are Gods <hi>hammers</hi> the word is called ſo by <hi>Ieremiah:</hi> Now take <hi>a greaſie</hi> thing and put it under a hammer, and it will <hi>ſlip</hi> on one ſide, and on another, and you can never ſtrike it juſtly: So you, if there be any thing that croſſes your humour; it is a <hi>hard ſaying,</hi> and away you goe; and were it not for your own <hi>meſerie</hi> it were no great <hi>loſſe.</hi> Therefore let me tell you, it is a <hi>principle</hi> that I am an enemie to whereſoever it is, and it is that I have bin hunting out; and let every one take his ſhare to open it, and labour to finde it out for his good; I would begine with my ſelfe, and I profeſſe before you, that there is no <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> that hath miſlead my ſoule, (to my greife) as this <hi>principle.</hi> Let me take my ſhare, and you yours, and ſuffer not your hearts to be above the word of God, and to run wild when any thing comes to do you good, but <hi>ſuffer the word of exhortation</hi> for your good; That is one thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is another thing, in all that I have
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:132715:102"/>ſaid (and I have ſpoken much concerning this) I have not in all this, (woe to me if I ſhould) ſought to <hi>inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. nothing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> or weaken any <hi>jot,</hi> or <hi>tittle,</hi> of any abſolute <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of God, concerning any <hi>good</hi> commanded, or any <hi>evil</hi> forbidden. Think not therefore (as I ſaid before) here is a latitude, <hi>Paul</hi> hath broken downe the hedge, and wee may doe what we liſt; No, in all things that God hath <hi>determined</hi> I have carried it ſo that I would not have the <hi>good</hi> omitted that he hath <hi>commanded,</hi> or the <hi>evil</hi> done that he hath <hi>forbidden.</hi> For I know what the Spirit faith in the cloſe of the booke of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, He that adds to this booke, God ſhall add to him all the plagues that are written in this booke, and he that puts to any thing, God ſhall put his name out of the booke of life,</hi> and I know that he that <hi>breaks the leaſt commandment, and teacheth men ſo to doe ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Mat. 5. Therefore I have not in all this ſought to weaken any one tittle, or thing abſolutely determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3. Not to abuſe this doctrine to ſtrife.</note>Thirdly, and laſtly, the maine aime of all was <hi>peace;</hi> therefore I would admoniſh you all of being like the <hi>Spider</hi> to draw <hi>poyſon</hi> out of the ſweeteſt <hi>flowers.</hi> If wee ſtudie to make peace, &amp; thou pickeſt occaſion of more <hi>warre,</hi> to <hi>jangle,</hi> and <hi>wrangle</hi> more; woe to thee, for if Chriſt ſay <hi>Bleſſed are the peace makers;</hi> than <hi>Curſed are the peace breakers;</hi> Thoſe that any way give juſt occaſion to break the <hi>peace</hi> of Gods people. And I am affraide notwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid, there are ſome among us, that I may ſay of them as <hi>David</hi> ſaith of ſome in his time, <hi>when I ſpeak of peace they prepare for warre;</hi> So, when we ſpeak of <hi>peace,</hi> and uſe means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the Saints, they pick occaſion of jangling, and wrangling. This is but to cleare the way;</p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:132715:103"/>
                  <p>So now, I proceed to that that remaines which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in two things.</p>
                  <p>The one is to point out breifly ſome hindrances in the way of the Saints that muſt be remooved, or elſe wee ſhall never walk according to this rule.</p>
                  <p>Seconly, to ſhew ſome few meanes (as we call them) externall meanes that God hath directed me to, how to come to ſquare our hearts, and lives, according to this rule.</p>
                  <p>But before I come to that there are two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections in the way, which I ſhall anſwer breifly.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> you will ſay, Sir, for all you ſay you ayme at <hi>peace,</hi> and you endeavour <hi>peace;</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding me thinks you ſeem to <hi>innervate</hi> the word of God, you ſeem to make a great deale of the word of God unprofitable: for if we muſt not make an abſolute <hi>rule</hi> of every thing here; what doe we with it? There will be a great deale void: for you told us that every <hi>example,</hi> no, not every <hi>precept,</hi> doth not make an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>rule</hi> to binde the Saints; ſo it ſeemes there will be a great deale void; and what ſhall wee doe with it?</p>
                  <p>To anſwer that briefly, I deny that there is any thing in this bleſſed <hi>booke</hi> that is <hi>unprofitable:</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> 
                     <note place="margin">Nothing in the Scripture but is of uſe.</note> but I deny this alſo that every thing in the New-Teſtament is profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to make a <hi>rule</hi> of, I will ſhew you two places of Scripture, the firſt is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Whatſoever things were written afore time, were written for our learning,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">But not every thing a rule.</note> 
                     <hi>that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi> That is, there are many things that are for <hi>comfort,</hi> there are many things that teach men the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteryes of <hi>faith,</hi> there are many ends to the word of God beſides making rules to binde us in our converſations.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:132715:103"/>It is more fully in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, and correction, and inſtruction in righteouſneſſe.</hi> It is profitable for <hi>doctrine,</hi> that is, to teach the myſteryes of heavenly things to be <hi>believed.</hi> And for <hi>reproofe;</hi> to ſhew us where we ſin againſt God, to help to convince us, as the Greek word ſignifies. And for <hi>correction;</hi> to help to heale our backſliding. And for <hi>inſtruction in righteouſneſſe;</hi> that is, to make <hi>rules,</hi> and <hi>lawes.</hi> So all the bleſſed booke is profitable: but I deny that God ever gave this booke to that end, to make rules and canons of every thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to anſwer that,<note place="margin">2. The Scripture not all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in Canons.</note> thoſe things that are rules for us to walk by, you muſt underſtand that they are not delivered to us in <hi>Theorems,</hi> or <hi>Theſis,</hi> they are not given in <hi>Canons,</hi> or <hi>Aphoriſmes;</hi> the word of God is not given ſo: Or more plainly, not as the ten <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi> were; where every thing was, <hi>thou ſhalt doe this,</hi> and <hi>thou ſhalt not doe that;</hi> it is not given ſo: but as our <hi>Common</hi> Law, as a <hi>rule</hi> to walk by: but wee muſt be very warie of drawing <hi>rules.</hi> We draw it ſometime from the letter of the Statute, ſometime from <hi>paralell</hi> caſes; ſometime from the caſe of ſuch a Judge upon ſuch a party, ſometime from <hi>right reaſon;</hi> ſometime from <hi>preſidents.</hi> So, think not to finde <hi>rules</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all in <hi>Canons,</hi> to binde all; No, there are few rules for <hi>converſation</hi> that are ſo. Indeed <hi>ſpeculative</hi> things, matters of <hi>faith,</hi> are laid down in <hi>Terminis,</hi> what to doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in matters of <hi>converſation</hi> it is not ſo. Therefore be wondrous wary how you draw a <hi>rule</hi> to walk by. As for inſtance, in the booke of. God wee read that <hi>Abraham</hi> by the command of God he muſt kill <hi>Iſaac:</hi> you cannot draw this rule or Doctrine
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:132715:104"/>thence that every man muſt goe, and <hi>kill</hi> his childe: but wee may draw this rule, that wee muſt <hi>part</hi> with the <hi>deareſt</hi> thing we have to obey God, So <hi>Paul circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Timothy,</hi> we cannot draw this <hi>doctrine,</hi> or rule <hi>thence,</hi> that we muſt goe and <hi>cicumciſe</hi> one another; but wee may this, that in things that are <hi>undetermined</hi> wee ſhould doe things ſo as we may avoyd <hi>offence; Paul</hi> wiſheth <hi>Timothy</hi> to take care of his <hi>cloak;</hi> wee cannot draw this rule, that we muſt leave our <hi>cloaks</hi> behinde us, and ſend our neighbours for them: but this wee may, that wee ought to be <hi>carefull</hi> of thoſe earthly things that God hath beſtowed upon us.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, it is not <hi>unwillingneſſe</hi> in honeſt hearts to walk by the <hi>rules</hi> of God that undoes their ſoules: for an honeſt heart will not balk the word of God, it will goe by that <hi>rule,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">miſdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of rules from Scripture.</note> but it is the <hi>miſdrawing</hi> of <hi>rules</hi> from the <hi>word</hi> of God. I pittie to ſee with what hearts, and <hi>conceits</hi> many draw <hi>rules</hi> from the word of God. As for inſtance, taking that text of our Saviour, <hi>ſome are made evnuches of men,</hi> they have gone and <hi>diſmembered</hi> themſelves. And ſo the Papiſts, in that Parable of <hi>Dives,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lazarus,</hi> out of <hi>Abrahams boſome,</hi> they would prove <hi>purgatorie.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Uſerers,</hi> becauſe God compares himſelf to one, they would prove it to be <hi>lawfull.</hi> And ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. they were to <hi>compell</hi> men to come to the <hi>feaſt;</hi> therefore men muſt <hi>compell</hi> others to be of what <hi>religion</hi> they pleaſe; Beware of this, and remember theſe two things; that all in this bleſſed booke is not for <hi>converſation;</hi> they have their uſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that. And ſecondly, be <hi>warie</hi> how you draw <hi>rules;</hi> Therefore weak Chriſtians when they draw rules out of the booke of God; ſay not onely Sir I walk by <hi>Scripture,</hi> here is my <hi>rule;</hi> but ask godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:132715:104"/>doe I draw this rule <hi>right?</hi> here is a text; is this a <hi>right</hi> conſequence? doth this riſe clearly from it? You ſhould doe ſo. But if you can get a <hi>line</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they hale it by the end, and run headlong, and make a <hi>rule</hi> of it: but beware of that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">To be wary of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rules from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture.</note>Therefore let me call upon you againe, I beſeech you remember that requeſt I made to you, that you would learne how much <hi>precept,</hi> or <hi>example,</hi> or what <hi>kinde</hi> of precept, and what kinde of <hi>example</hi> goes to make an abſolute rule to <hi>all</hi> the Saints in the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> determine that, or you can doe nothing. As in a Court when a Delinquent comes to be tryed, they ask him who he will be <hi>tryed</hi> by; ſome are tryed by the <hi>Peers,</hi> others by the <hi>Countrie.</hi> So, lay down a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard out of the word by which you may <hi>judge:</hi> there are none that have taken paines yet in it. It may be God may give ſome Chriſtians opportunitie to do a little hereafter in that buſines. But otherwiſe, never ſay, I have <hi>Scripture</hi> for it on my ſide, men make Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeak any thing. Therefore all the miſerie of an honeſt hearted ſoule is, not that he walks not by rule: but that he <hi>miſdrawes</hi> his rules; he pulls them by head, and ſhoulders, and drawes them not right.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>Ojection</hi> is this, but you will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> this is very ſtrange, that <hi>Moſes</hi> by your confeſſion ſhould make a <hi>curtous</hi> peice to an <hi>ilet</hi> hole, to the very burying of their <hi>excrements,</hi> and that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo <hi>faithfull</hi> in his houſe, and that the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God ſhould not be ſo <hi>faithfull</hi> in the new Teſtament; this is a common argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is ſtrange that the Sonne of God ſhould not be ſo faithful in laying down every tittle as <hi>Moſes</hi> was who was but a ſervant.</p>
                  <p>But to anſwer that, it ſounds to me like that reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:132715:105"/>that I heare among ſimple people; when wee ſay they muſt goe to hell if they continue in their ſins; ſay they, is not God ſtronger than the devill? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt goe to heaven, though they continue unbelievers; doth that follow?</p>
                  <p>So here, muſt it follow that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not <hi>faithfull</hi> as <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe he hath not made ſo curious a peice in <hi>externall</hi> things in the New Teſtament? That is not the thing. VVhat was <hi>faithfulnes</hi> in <hi>Moſes?</hi> To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and deliver to the people <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> of God; though <hi>Moſes</hi> did not deliver all: for <hi>David</hi> delivered much concerning <hi>ſinging,</hi> and other things: But all that God told him he delivered; and ſo he was <hi>faithfull.</hi> So; what was <hi>faithfulnes</hi> in <hi>Chriſt?</hi> That all that he had <hi>ſeen, and heard of his father,</hi> he told to his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> Therefore, I retort the argument thus, and that truly, and rightly; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> Jeſus did not deliver any ſuch <hi>curious</hi> peice in externall things in the New Teſtament, therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> Jeſus was <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;</hi> he being faithfull there is no ſuch thing to be found there: To make it a little plainer by an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, ſuppoſe a <hi>Gentleman</hi> in the Countrie ſhould have a <hi>Son,</hi> and a <hi>ſervant,</hi> both <hi>faithfull</hi> as he judgeth; and he ſhould ſend his ſervant into <hi>Cheap ſide,</hi> or ſome other Market, to buy a great deale of <hi>meat,</hi> and <hi>ſpice,</hi> and <hi>ſuger,</hi> and <hi>cloathes,</hi> and the like; and he ſhould ſend his ſonne with <hi>letters</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> with meſſages to the Committees of State; they both goe home, they have both done their errand; now ſhould that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſay that his ſonne was unfaithfull, becauſe hee did not bring as much <hi>luggage</hi> home as the <hi>ſervant?</hi> No; it was the meſſage of the ſervant to fetch <hi>luggage:</hi> but it was the meſſage of the ſon to deliver his <hi>meſſage.</hi>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:132715:105"/>So, the meſſage of <hi>Moſes</hi> it was <hi>luggage,</hi> to teach them endleſſe, <hi>externall</hi> lawes, and things: but the deſigne of the Sonne of God, his meſſage was to declare the ſercret ſpirituall myſteryes of his Father to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in the New Teſtament; therefore it is no ſence, much leſſe truth to ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> becauſe he hath not as many curious ties in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things as <hi>Moſes.</hi> So I have done with thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection..</p>
                  <p>Now breifly, to end all at this time, there are two things remaine.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to point out the hindrances, that keep us from walking according to this truth.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, to ſhew you certaine meanes that may further you in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>The hindrances are theſe foure, or five.</p>
                  <p>The one that you muſt take heed of <hi>engaging</hi> your ſelves with any party in Religion beyond your owne <hi>principles.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond mens principles.</note> Religion is already in a faction among ſome Saints, men are readie to cry, <hi>I am for Paul, and I am for Apollo, and I am for Cephas.</hi> Now I would not have you perſecute others by no meanes: but I would have you love all Saints, all that <hi>call on the name of the Lord with a pure heart;</hi> and honour <hi>all</hi> Saints without faction: but take heed of running into any of theſe partyes whatſoever, beyond your owne <hi>principle,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than you have a cleare light, that you can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer comfortably for it, at the laſt day before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Hence is this running into faction; that I beleive there are thouſands of men and women, that profeſſe themſelves now <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that know not, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what <hi>Presbytery</hi> is; men ſcarſly know what
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:132715:106"/>they ſay, and yet I am a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> &amp; run into facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So, many in that way that you call <hi>Independency,</hi> that out of ſome motive of truth that they ſee in it, &amp; their good neighbours, and friends that are of it; they run a long in it; and what followes? When they come to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> in death, or the like caſe, they either goe <hi>back</hi> with ſhame, and greive their brethren, or elſe they go on uncomfortably, for that that they have not a ſeale to their conſcience. So now I may ſay in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that people generally believe as the <hi>Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,</hi> as the faction that they joyne themſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Therefore beware of this, this is not a time for men to ſee with other mens eyes; <hi>Try all things, &amp; hold faſt that which is good. Let every man prove his own work.</hi> Love all Saints if there be any thing of God in them: but walk not according to any mans rules, or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, farther than God cleares it to your ſoules.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Act. 17.21.</note> 
                     <hi>(who ſpent their time in nothing elſe: but either to tell, or to heare ſome newes.)</hi> And yet the news wee beare is ſometimes <hi>bad,</hi> ſometimes <hi>uncertain,</hi> and many times <hi>falſe.</hi> Divert thy thoughts awhile from earthly things, and in this enſuing Treatiſe thou ſhalt heare, what newes from heaven in the Goſpel. The Law indeed brings us tidings: but it is like the meſſage of <hi>Ehud,</hi> to <hi>Eglon,</hi> it brings a dagger with it that ſtabs mortally:<note place="margin">Judge 3.21.</note> but the ridings of the Goſpel is like that meſſage of the <hi>young Prophet</hi> to <hi>Jehu,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. King. 9.6</note> to make him a King.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing truly terrible, but the Goſpel brings tidings of our freedome from it, (if we be believers) nor nothing truly amiable, but it tells us of our intereſt in it. How welcome to a poore captive is newes of deliverance from ſlaverie? The Goſpel brings us tidings of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from <hi>ſin, Satan, death, hell,</hi> from <hi>wrath,</hi> and <hi>damnation,</hi> it tells us of <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,</hi> and <hi>Crownes,</hi> and whatſoever may ſatisfie the capacious ſoule of man.</p>
                  <p>God hath appointed different conditions for men, and Angels, the Angels that ſtood they are ſo confirmed that
<pb facs="tcp:132715:112"/>they cannot fall; the Angels that fell they are determined under eternall wrath that they cannot riſe, but God from everlaſting in his love, and mercy had appointed that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man ſhould have a way of recovery, as a board after ſhipwracke, whereby he might come ſafe to the ſhore. And God in time was pleaſed to come out of his hidden eternity, and to diſcover this love of his to the world, and hath ſent his Son to puhchaſe it, and his Spirit to apply it, and his ſervants to tell (not this, or that perticuler man) but <hi>all Nations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat 28.19 Luk. 2.10 Joh. 3.16.</note> that <hi>whoſoever believeth in Jeſus Chriſt ſhall have everlaſting life</hi> this bleſſed tidings is brought by the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>And let none ſay this newes is to good to be true, for God who is truth it ſelfe (as it were on purpoſe) to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the infidelity of man, hath <hi>ſaid</hi> it, and <hi>ſworne</hi> it, and <hi>ſealed</hi> it with the blood of his deare Son, <hi>that we might have ſtrong conſolation;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 6.8.</note> and hath made this fabrick of the world to be as a ſtage to act the redemption of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on, which being finiſhed, it ſhall be no more.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould ſtir us up to love, and bleſſe the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and the holy Spirit; and to imbrace the Meſſengers that bring thoſe glad tidings, to account their very <hi>feet beautifull,</hi> the meaneſt part of the body, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moutaines,<note place="margin">Iſa. 52.7.</note> the barren places of the earth.

                     <note place="margin">Goſpel what meant by it.</note>Firſt, what is meant by <hi>Goſpel? Goe, and preach the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, what is meant by creature? <hi>Goe preach the Goſpel to every creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt, what is meant by Goſpel? I will not ſtand upon the ſeverall acceptations of it, onely you may underſtand that both in the Scripture language, and alſo among the Heathen, <hi>Goſpel</hi> hath been taken for <hi>Glad tidings, good newes</hi> in generall; any <hi>Good newes,</hi> or <hi>Glad tidings</hi> have been called <hi>Goſpel;</hi> So the <hi>Greek</hi> word ſignifies, ſo ſome conceive the <hi>Engliſh</hi> word <hi>Godſpel,</hi> being old <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that is, <hi>good ſpeech,</hi> good <hi>newes,</hi> good <hi>hearing,</hi> good <hi>tidings:</hi> but in a peculiar ſenſe in Scripture it is taken for that <hi>Good tidings</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo in this ſenſe we read of it in the old Teſtament, and in the new. In the old Teſtament, you ſhall read in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. that our Fathers they had the <hi>Goſpel</hi> as well as we: but (Beloved) you are to take notice, that though our Fathers had the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that is, the glad tidings of life and ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, from <hi>Adam,</hi> from the beginning of the world, yet they had it but dimly, and darkly; and they had it mixed with a great deale of <hi>Law,</hi> a great deale of bad tidings (as I may ſpeak) they had a little <hi>good</hi> newes with a great deale of <hi>bad.</hi> So <hi>Adam</hi> had a little good tidings <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head;</hi> and there was bad tidings alſo, there was the curſe upon the Serpent, and upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:132715:113"/>the woman, &amp; the man; the woman ſhould bring forth in paine, the man muſt eat his bread in the ſweat of his browes; And ſo in all the old Teſtament, there was a little <hi>Goſpel</hi> in the Prophecies, and <hi>Goſpel</hi> in the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and <hi>Goſpel</hi> in the viſions, but abundance of <hi>law</hi> mingled with this <hi>Goſpel;</hi> the one ſpake <hi>ſad tidings,</hi> as well as the other did <hi>good;</hi> for you know the Law ſpake <hi>curſes</hi> and <hi>damnation</hi> to thoſe that in every point did not obſerve it: But in the new Teſtament, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, when he went up to Heaven, we read that there was perfect <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or only <hi>good</hi> newes, and <hi>glad</hi> tidings, for the <hi>bad</hi> newes was now all gone. And ſo it is to be underſtood here, <hi>Goe preach the Goſpel.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I doe not (my diſciples) bid you goe and give them now <hi>good</hi> newes, and then <hi>bad,</hi> to give them a <hi>little</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and a <hi>line</hi> of <hi>Goſpel:</hi> but goe preach the <hi>Goſpel</hi> empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, that is, meerly, purely <hi>Goſpel;</hi> for now Chriſt is riſen from the dead, and now the Goſpel in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſimplicity is erected, <hi>Goe preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>

                     <hi>[To every creature]</hi> What ſhould be the meaning of that? We know that in the Scripture language, <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> moſt uſually ſignifies not men but <hi>beaſts,</hi> &amp; things <hi>without life,</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. you have it twice, or thrice <hi>The creature groaneth;</hi> the beaſts, and the woods, and every thing that God hath made, as being a name ſomewhat too low for men in the ordinary Scripture expreſſion. Yet ſo as it comprehends men: for men alſo are ſometimes called <hi>creatures.</hi> Now, what ſhould the meaning of this be, that now the Goſpel being to be purely, and fully, and compleatly ſet up, whether the Lord Jeſus would have them preach, and make
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:132715:114"/>known glad tidings to <hi>all creatures,</hi> that is, that even the bruit <hi>beaſts,</hi> and theſe creatures without <hi>life,</hi> that they ſhould have glad tidings, and good newes from the death and reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I will not averr that it is ſo, that that is the meaning of it: but ſurely (beloved) there is <hi>no</hi> creature under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but hath a great deale of <hi>glad tidings,</hi> and <hi>good newes</hi> from the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt: for we read <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. that the <hi>creature groanes,</hi> and the <hi>creature exſpects deliverance,</hi> and redemption. All theſe creatures by ſinne are brought into ſlavery, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they ſhall partake of the <hi>libertie of the Sonnes of God:</hi> there is a redemption for them out of ſlavery, as well as for men by the redemption of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: But what that ſhall be, or in what ſort I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine. Now whether you will underſtand it ſo, that our Lord Chriſt meant not men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men only, but that by <hi>creature,</hi> the poore <hi>creatures</hi> that are <hi>without life,</hi> and <hi>bruit beaſts,</hi> and all might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the precious worth of this Goſpel.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:132715:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>after he had walked among men for many yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that then as a Publicke perſon,<note place="margin">6.

                  <p>But you will ſay, Where is the good newes from that? Hence it is that poore ſinners are reconciled to God, they are made friends with God.

                  <p>Then the Goſpel tells you that Jeſus Chriſt, as hee died for our ſins, ſo <hi>he roſe againe for our juſtification,</hi> he roſe againe from the dead the third day,<note place="margin">7.

                  <p>Then the Goſpel tells you that after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he converſed with his <hi>Diſciples,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">8.

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:132715:120"/>
                  <p>And then you know the Goſpel tells us that he went up into <hi>heaven,</hi>

                  <p>And the Goſpel tells us this good newes that when he went to heaven he made way for poore ſinners to come there,<note place="margin">10. Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for us.</note> and that there he intercedes for us, and there ſuccours us, and pities us when we are in the fleſh as he was once.</p>
                  <p>Then the Goſpel tells us that in due time he will come againe from heaven as he went,<note place="margin">11. ſhall come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and bring a Crowne with him, and actually ſubdue all his peoples enemies, and give them the ſame glory that he hath, and they ſhall be one with God for ever as he is; he will come and take poore ſinners to himſelfe, that they ſhall be <hi>where</hi> he is, and <hi>as</hi> he is, world without end.</p>
                  <p>The Goſpel tells you moreover that all this love,<note place="margin">12.

We finde in ſome caſes that the Lord Jeſus, will have us not only <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>exhort,</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> one another: but in ſome caſes he will have us <hi>reprove</hi> one another,<note place="margin">Benefit of Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> and have our Miniſters <hi>reprove</hi> us alſo, but in <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>tendernes.</hi> This is one of the harſheſt things; and this if you look right on it with a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> eye, truly it is <hi>glad tidings</hi> for a poore Saint, when he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got himſelf, by the violence of ſome <hi>luſt;</hi> Then for a ſincere hearted Brother, or Siſter in the ſpirit of <hi>meeknes,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> to <hi>reprove</hi> him, and ſet his <hi>bones</hi> in joynt. You have ſome of you found in experience that a <hi>ſweet,</hi> and wiſe reproofe hath been as <hi>pleaſing</hi> to you as any <hi>Sermon</hi> of conſolation that ever you heard. And therefore you ſee in Scripture how the Lord ſets downe <hi>reproofe,</hi> that you may not be affraid of it <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. he tells you that <hi>reproofe</hi> is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of love, <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, but rather reprove him.</hi> It is an argument of love.

                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:132715:128"/>he loves him: for otherwiſe his poore ſoule is going in the way towards hell, from God, and fellowſhip with God, going on in ſin.

If reproofe were an evil thing, one could not ſay that the Scripture were profitable for ſuch an end.</p>
                  <p>It is a great <hi>judgment</hi> of God, when God caſts a man into ſuch a condition that no body will <hi>reprove</hi> him. It is a thing that I am many times affraid of, truly almoſt to trembling, leaſt a man ſhould ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie himſelfe to the Saints, and ſo eſtrange himſelfe that they will not <hi>reprove</hi> him; O, it is fearefull when a man ſtands on his owne bottome, and on his owne leggs, that men ſhall ſay, there is a Profeſſor, he is ſo <hi>proud,</hi> and ſo <hi>fooliſh</hi> that none will <hi>reprove</hi> him. Saith God to <hi>Ezkiel, Thou ſhalt not be a reprover to this pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 3. <hi>Let no man ſtrive, or reprove an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> Why ſo? ſaith the Lord in the end of the Chapter, <hi>Let him be as a backſliding heifer, Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</hi> It is a pitifull thing when God ſhall leave a man as a <hi>heifer,</hi> that is turned into the <hi>meddow</hi> to graſſe, <hi>let him alone.</hi> They uſed to plow

It is a great <hi>judgment</hi> to be without it: therefore though that be uſed, the doctrine holds true, that there is nothing but good newes, glad tidings in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>There is another thing, that is, <hi>Excommunication,</hi>

                  <p>The firſt is this, that this truth that I have now taught you, it is the <hi>doore</hi> of the Goſpel, the very <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance</hi> into <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion; the firſt <hi>ſtone</hi> as it were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:132715:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the Chriſtian <hi>building</hi> in the <hi>Profeſsion</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> in <hi>Goſpel</hi> Profeſſion. There is a kinde of devotion and Profeſſion, but it is not built according to the Goſpel: but if you would walk according to the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> learne this leſſon firſt, that is, that God gives <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> through Chriſt to <hi>ſinners,</hi> as <hi>ſinners</hi> though they be <hi>hard hearted, backſliding,</hi> and the <hi>cheife of ſinners,</hi> yet as long as they be <hi>ſinners,</hi> and but <hi>ſinners</hi> they may alway looke upon Jeſus <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> in his hand to beſtowed on them. This is a truth that thou muſt learne, and be taught it of God, or elſe thou canſt not goe one ſtep into the Profeſſion of the Goſpel; for (beloved) till you know and learne this, you will be like men in the <hi>dark,</hi> you will be <hi>groping</hi> for Chriſt Jeſus, but you will never be <hi>graffed</hi> into him, you will never be <hi>knit</hi> to Chriſt. I ſay this is the firſt ſtep to Religion to underſtand this truth aright, that the Goſpel brings <hi>glad tidings</hi> of ſalvation to be given to the <hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>ſinners:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for though I ſee no good in me at all whereby I might receive <hi>good newes</hi> from the <hi>Law,</hi> and though I doe not ſee that I am a <hi>humbled</hi> ſinner as ſuch a Preacher teacheth, or a <hi>believing</hi> ſinner, or a <hi>broken hearted</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as another Preacher ſaith, yet I ſay I am a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and a <hi>ſinner quaſi,</hi>
